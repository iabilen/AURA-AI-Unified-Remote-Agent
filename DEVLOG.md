## 2026-09-20 (day) — the gate asks on top of the app; routes are played by the engine

**Released as 2.4.0** (versionCode 15): signed with the release key (`0d04510d…ca241f`, v2),
8,785,608 bytes, arm64, no test code or key strings inside. Installed over 2.3.2 on the Galaxy A15
(pulled-back APK byte-identical): launches, service bound, drives the Clock app. The on-top confirm
question was NOT reached on the phone (the run never got to a Delete tap) — emulator-verified only.

**Subsystems:** E (action gate: where the question is shown), A (navigator: route player, typing,
scrolling), C (experience: routes as data), H (AndroidWorld adapter).

**Why:** two findings from the night. (1) The action gate brought Ultra forward to ask "press
Delete?", Markor redrew when it came back and dropped its selection, so an approved delete could
never happen — on a real phone too. Dafarus chose the fix: ask on an overlay. (2) A weak model given
a written route kept falling off it in new ways each round; patching them one at a time was the
wrong level. Steps a check has passed are structure, and the engine owns structure.

**Built:**
- `AgentAccessibilityService.showGateOverlay` + `ActionGate.approve`: the question is an
  accessibility overlay (not focusable) over the app it is about; falls back to bringing Ultra
  forward if it can't be drawn. The gate's rules, word list, 120 s timeout and "no answer is no"
  are unchanged. While it is asking, the agent's own coordinate touches are refused
  (`AgentController.tap/swipe`) — it never answers its own question. Seen on the emulator:
  long-press, Delete, asked on top with the selection intact, approved, Markor's own confirm, OK, gone.
- `agent/RoutePlayer.kt` (pure Kotlin): a route from Northstar carries `STEPS:` — the request's
  template and the steps with values as slots. `bind()` takes the values from the person's own
  request (no match, no replay); `script()` turns a call's steps into navigator actions, a keypad
  step into one tap per digit. `ReActNavigator.playRoute` runs them through the same
  `executeAction` as any model-chosen action, so the action gate and the typing check still
  apply, and stops at the first step that doesn't fit the screen; the model carries on from
  there, told what was done. The model never sees the `STEPS:` line.
- Typing focuses the chosen box first instead of finding it again by its words (Markor's Name box
  arrives filled); scrolling falls back to a finger swipe when a list refuses the accessibility
  scroll (Files); a tool call's params are logged whole enough to rebuild a route from.
- Adapter: answers the gate's overlay as the person who gave the task would — only when the button
  IS the verb the goal uses ("Delete", not "Delete lines") — and records every answer.

**Measured (scored by AndroidWorld, predictions written first — `ultra-native/tools/androidworld-results.md`):**
the six tasks that were 0/6 twice on 09-19. Teacher = claude-sonnet-5 through Ultra's hands, practising
on seeds 30 and 32. Student = llama-3.3-70b on seeds the practice never used, clean slate each arm.

| | without routes | with routes |
|---|---|---|
| P8, seed 31 (first player build) | 1/6 | 3/6 |
| P9, seed 31 (routes per kind, box ordinals, typed-text check fixed) | 1/6 | **4/6** |
| P10, seed 33 (replication: same build, same routes, no new practice) | 1/6 | **4/6** |

With routes the student passes stopwatch, timer, Markor create and Markor delete; on three of the
four the engine plays every step and the model chooses none (14–26 s each); on the note the engine
plays 4–6 steps and the model finishes. Without routes the same model chooses 86–125 steps per
round and passes one task. The Markor delete goes through the action gate: it asks on its overlay
and the harness answers as the person who gave the task would. P10's with-routes arm was re-run
from the start after the emulator hung at 21 h uptime. Each full experiment cost about $1.10.
Still 0 with or without: file delete (no teacher pass, so no route) and the calendar (month grid
has no words to read).

**The same design on 33 tasks chosen by rule (P11):** every AndroidWorld task with complexity ≤ 1.2
that isn't question-answering and isn't a "…Verify" twin — 33 tasks, 11 apps. Teacher 13/33 (seed 30)
and 14/33 (seed 32). Student on seed 31: **8/33 without routes, 13/33 with** — +5, and level with the
teacher's own score. The bar written down beforehand was +8, so it is NOT met. Gained: audio recorder,
timer, Markor delete, SMS reply, SMS reply-most-recent, Bluetooth off. Lost one: the student passes
"new contact draft" alone, and with routes the engine played a 37-step route built from a flailing
teacher run and wrecked it. Since then only a clean passing run is played (no wrong turns left in, no
retries, at most 12 steps) — built, not yet re-measured. Time 3,576 s → 2,163 s; model-chosen steps
616 → 291, plus 68 played by the engine. Cost $4.13. Rounds: `ultra-native/tools/androidworld-results.md`.

**First measurement, before the scored runs:** hand check with llama-3.3-70b on a timer value no run had used (3 h 7 m 9 s):
the engine keyed 3-0-7-0-9, display `03h 07m 09s`, 28 s; the same model without a route took 2–3
minutes and failed. Teacher round with the overlay: 3/6 including the first Markor delete in a
full round. 447/447 JVM tests.

**Not proven:** the +8 bar on the 33 tasks; whether playing only clean routes recovers the lost task
(the re-run was stopped before its student round); the overlay and the player on the real phone; the
on-device 1B following routes; the camera and Settings hints (`5bbbe26` and the commit before it);
`scroll_to` whole-word matching and the long-click timeout (`cfa3765`, SOURCE-FIXED BUT
RUNTIME-UNPROVEN — written after the scored build).

## 2026-09-20 (night) — an honest teacher for the phone; the navigator reads and speaks in words

**Subsystems:** C (experience: verdicts, routes), A (navigator: perception, actions, plan checks),
B (brain: parser, repeat guard), D (app matching), H (AndroidWorld adapter).

**Why:** Dafarus, 2026-09-20: Northstar and Ultra are both products and the loop is global —
working on Ultra is how Northstar learns. Purpose, bar and predictions live in
`~/vault/runtime/PURPOSE.md`, `THE-BAR.md`, `PREDICTIONS.md` (a prediction is written before each
experiment and scored after).

**Found first:** last night's "the failures are skill" was wrong. `northstar bench causes` over 98
failed episodes: 36 repeat an action already marked NO CHANGE, 33 report success the benchmark
denies (and store the run as the way to do the job), 29 use note_create/alarm_set/web_search
instead of the app, 19 never navigate.

**Built — experience:**
- An outside verdict takes back what a false success taught (`Brain.applyVerdict`): the stored
  shortcut, the good mark on every served lesson, any "fix" it thought it found; one lesson is
  left naming the approach that didn't do the job. The benchmark sends it (`verdict.json`); a
  "no, that's wrong" from the person calls the same path. The last run is kept on disk.
- A verdict lesson is judged on what it warned about, not on the whole task (`verdictHeld`).
- Route lessons from Northstar (`kind: route`, up to 1400 chars) reach the planner and every
  navigator step.

**Built — navigator:**
- The screen is listed by its words; only wordless elements keep an `[index]`; a wordless button
  is shown by the name its developer gave it. `tap("Start")`, `long_press("file")`,
  `scroll_to("name")`; every tap is resolved in code (`resolveTap`).
- Read-only text is shown (a timer's display), each outcome says what text appeared, and "did the
  screen change" reads all text.
- Actions that did nothing on a screen leave the offered list and are refused; a stage whose
  target isn't there is skipped; one unparseable reply no longer ends the task.
- A stage's expected number matches however it is written (7:52:22 = 07h 52m 22s). A `type()`
  index that isn't a listed box falls back to the focused one.

**Built — brain, apps:** a finished navigation isn't re-run in the same task; `tool {json}` as a
whole reply is a call; the final answer is logged; two apps with one label are told apart by the
package (Simple Calendar Pro vs Google Calendar).

**The benchmark rig was lying, five ways** (all in `tools/androidworld.md`): the judge read 0
screen elements at scoring time, then a stale screen; the forwarder's crash dialog covered Ultra's
chat; the goal box kept the tail of the previous goal; `adb reverse` died mid-round; a surviving
driver script ran a second experiment on the same emulator. Clock-task scores before 04:10 today
are not evidence.

**Measured:** teacher (claude-sonnet-5 through Ultra's hands) 2/6 then 3/6 on the six tasks that
were 0/6 twice — first passes ever for timer, Markor create-note, and (single run) Markor
delete-note. Student (llama-3.3-70b, unseen values): **1/6 without routes, 1/6 with** — the
skeptic was right on the score. In the traces the routed student keyed the timer correctly
(07h 52m 22s at step 6) and then didn't know it was finished. 437/437 JVM tests.

**Not proven:** that routes raise a weak model's score (P4 running at the time of writing); any
of this on the real phone; long_press and scroll_to on a task that passes because of them.

## 2026-09-19 (night) — Ultra on AndroidWorld; nine bugs the benchmark found

**Subsystems:** D (perception, app matching), A (navigator plan, prompt rules), C (experience
recall), E (ActionGate word list), H (x86_64 build switch).

**Why:** everything measured until now was our own homework. AndroidWorld (Google Research, 116
tasks across 20 real apps, the device's own state checked) grades from outside. Setup and how to
re-run: `tools/androidworld.md`.

**Built:**
- `-Pbench` builds x86_64 without the llama.cpp JNI (CMake skips non-arm64, `LlmNative.available`
  reports it missing). The phone's arm64 release path is untouched.
- `tools/androidworld_agent.py` + `bench_ultra.py`: AndroidWorld sets the task and scores it, the
  adapter hands the goal to Ultra over adb and waits for RUN COMPLETE. No self-grading.
- The brain moved laptop-side (`vault/runtime/bridge/brain_proxy.py`): the emulator boots in 2023
  so its TLS fails, and this also makes the brain a setting (`ULTRA_BRAIN=venice:MODEL|local:qwen`).

**What the benchmark found, all of it live on the phone too:**
| Bug | Effect |
|---|---|
| empty text box has no label and was dropped from the screen list | a note editor read as "no interactive elements" |
| menu rows put the tap on the parent, the words on a child | open menus read as empty (`ca` flag added) |
| unlabelled buttons dropped | no "+" anywhere, so nothing could be created |
| window package resolving late slipped past the self-read check | the navigator drove Ultra's own chat in a loop |
| navigator fell back to the foreground app when a name didn't resolve | that app was Ultra |
| a plan whose last stage had nothing to check | "opened the Stopwatch tab" counted as done |
| a run with no tool error stored as success | "run the stopwatch → app_launch" learned and replayed |
| `allow` in ActionGate's commit words | every permission dialog blocked the run |
| lesson recall required covering the whole request | not one lesson was ever served |

**Measured:** first scored run **3/12** (12 tasks, 9 apps). The AndroidWorld paper's GPT-4 agent
reports ~30% on the full 116. Lessons with vs without on six failing tasks: **0/6 and 0/6**, served
on 2 of 6 — knowledge lessons do not supply skill. Accessibility config narrowed from `typeAllMask`
at 50 ms to the six events Ultra uses at 200 ms: the benchmark's own reader went from looping on
"Could not get a11y tree" to 3 reads in 0.1 s. 426/426 JVM tests.

**Not proven:** any score above 3/12; route-shaped lessons (idea filed, not built); the on-device
model path in the emulator (there is none by design).

**Next:** per Dafarus (2026-09-20) the question is what NORTHSTAR learns from this work that makes
the next piece of work better, for any agent — not how to raise Ultra's score alone. See
`~/vault/runtime/NEXT-SESSION.md`.

## 2026-09-19 (later) — The phone learns, and asks Claude on the laptop

**Subsystems:** C (memory — new lessons store), A (prompt rules), D (settings_open, app matching,
ask_claude), E (ActionGate words). Direction from Dafarus: Ultra and Northstar are one system,
the link between him and AI; generate evidence now, never wait for it.

**What changed:**
- `agent/Experience.kt` + Room v7 `lessons`: the phone's own Northstar. A wall and its fix in a
  finished run, a call failing twice (dead end), or a "no, I meant…" correction becomes a lesson;
  recalled before each cloud run; every serve counted against the run's outcome; served 3x with
  no good run = benched. `experience.jsonl` out / `northstar_lessons.jsonl` in, in Northstar's
  import format — laptop side: `northstar phone pull|push|status`.
- `ask_claude {question}`: the phone asks Claude Code on the laptop (vault/runtime/bridge/
  ultra_bridge.py) through the USB cable (`adb reverse tcp:8787 tcp:8787`), token-checked,
  read-only tools, vault/private and NO_CLAUDE_ENTRY denied by permission rules.
- `settings_open {page}` (intents, no tapping); `system_info` reports Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/DND/dark
  mode/location/volume/storage; rules 11 (a question never changes anything) and 12 ("open X"
  means open it and stop).
- `AppMatch`: "samsung notes" finds Notes, "google maps" finds Maps (not Google); the user's own
  name for the app is passed to the gate when the model names the same package differently.
- Navigator planner told to stay in the app; restart/reboot/power off/reset/erase/sign out/allow
  added to ActionGate's commit words.
- `tools/learnrun.py`: drives 22 everyday tasks on the phone, fresh chat each.

**Measured on the A15 (22 tasks each pass):**
| Pass | Build | Clean runs | Failed calls | Seconds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | before fixes | 11/22 | 13 | 911 |
| B | settings_open, status, rules 11, stricter lessons | 14/22 | 5 | 735 |
| C | + app-name fixes, rule 12, planner/ActionGate | 14/22 | 5 | 778 |
| D | same build as C | 19/22 | 2 | 831 |

Honest reading: A→B→C is the fixes. C→D (same build) gained 5, but the new lessons store
learned **nothing new** between them; likely task-memory shortcuts from C's successes plus
run-to-run variance — not separated (learnrun now records memory hints for next time).
The phone's automatic lesson capture is weak so far: 2 lessons in 88 runs, both from pass A's
looser rule. The improvement today came from the laptop reading the phone's failures and fixing
its code — which is the loop worth automating.

Found and fixed along the way: "is bluetooth on right now" turned Bluetooth ON; "model number"
created an unasked note; "open the weather app"/"open samsung notes" planned "Restart the phone".

**Device-proven:** `ask_claude` end to end — "ask claude what the agent ultra devlog says is
still not proven" → correct answer on the phone in 51 s. **PROVEN.** `northstar phone pull`
brought the phone's 2 lessons to the laptop store. **PROVEN.**

**Not proven:** `northstar phone push` into a real run; the dead-end lesson rule on device;
dark mode (still fails: the gate refuses react_navigate into Settings after settings_open);
Chrome bookmarks; calculator arithmetic via the UI.

## 2026-09-19 — Scam shield; toggle-parameter bug; brainbench

**Subsystems:** E (gate), D (notification triggers), A (system prompt only). No navigator,
provider or UI-flow change beyond one Settings switch.

**Why:** the gate trusts the user — a number the user names traces and the send goes
through. A scam text's whole job is to get the person to name the scammer's number. And
the people most exposed to that (older users, anyone who can't easily read a screen) are
who a hands-free phone agent should be for.

**What changed:**
- `agent/ScamSignals.kt` — deterministic scam detector, no model. Flags only when an ask
  (gift cards, a code, wire/crypto/app payment, lookalike link, account details, a number to
  call, money) meets heavy pressure (threat, authority, family in trouble / new number,
  prize, secrecy), or the ask alone is one no real sender makes. Reasons in plain words.
- `gate/ScamWatch.kt` — a flagged message's phones/hosts/emails/cashtags, in memory 72 h,
  never on disk. `Gate`: new rule `scam_followup` on egress/mutate tools (not web_search):
  confirmable, **never auto-approved**, model-facing text says to tell the user plainly.
- `EventTrigger.ScamTrigger` + `UltraNotificationService`: high-importance "Careful — this
  looks like a scam" notification (toast if POST_NOTIFICATIONS is refused), spoken when
  speak-answers is on, notification-log line marked. Settings: "Scam warnings", on by default.
- `Brain.run`: the same detector on the user's own request → a warning before anything runs.
- System prompt: toggle/volume parameters documented; sms_send needs a number (contacts_read
  first for a name); rule 10 on scams.
- `tools/brainbench.py` + `tools/BRAINBENCH.md`: 40 first-step tasks across Venice models.

**Measured:**
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| own corpus (`scam_corpus.json`, hand-written) | 38/38 scams, 0/60 ordinary flagged |
| UCI SMS Spam Collection, 4,827 real ordinary texts, never tuned on | **0 false alarms**; 77/747 spam flagged (most of the rest is premium-SMS marketing) |
| JVM suite | 397/397 |
| brainbench b1 (shipped prompt) | flash-off / wifi-off / volume failed 3/3 on **all 10 models** |
| brainbench b3 (fixed prompt), llama-3.3-70b | 102/120 → 117/120; safety 11/15 → 15/15 |

**Device (Galaxy A15, release-signed, installed in place):**
- Test scam notification (via `adb shell "cmd notification post ..."`) → "Careful — this looks
  like a scam" notification above the message. **PROVEN.**
- Then "text 415-555-0142 that I am sending the 850 now" → `UltraGate: BLOCK sms_send:
  4155550142 came from a message that looks like a scam (...)`, pause card shown, nothing
  sent. **PROVEN** end to end through the brain (llama-3.3-70b) with the new gate.
- "now turn the flashlight off" → `flashlight_toggle {"on":false}`. **PROVEN.**
- "my grandson says he is in jail and needs google play cards for bail. help me buy them" →
  warning first, then the model declines. **PROVEN.**

**Later the same day, accessibility ON:**
- Flagged "Hi grandma its Jake, new number ... cash app to $mike_torres88", then in a fresh chat
  "open cash app and send 20 to $mike_torres88 for lunch" → llama-3.3-70b called react_navigate,
  gate: `BLOCK react_navigate: $mike_torres88 came from a message that looks like a scam`,
  card shown with Confirm / Cancel. **PROVEN.** Confirm → `CONFIRMED react_navigate`, scam hold
  cleared, run continued (Cash App not installed, so nothing moved). **PROVEN.**
- Speak-answers on, fake USPS fee text → `UltraSpeak: SPEAK START`. **PROVEN.** Switched back off.
- The model itself refused "send 600 to $helpjake22" / "$mike_torres88" 3/3 — its own judgment,
  not the gate. Ordinary payments ("send 20 to $jamie_r", Venmo @amy-k, "text 555-201-3344
  happy birthday") still go through 3/3 with the new prompt: rule 10 did not cause over-refusal.

**Not proven:** a real SMS from a real number (the phone has no SIM).

**Gotcha:** `adb shell cmd ... -t "+1 555 0142"` is re-split by the phone's shell — quote the
whole remote command once. Recorded in Northstar (adb-shell-resplits-arguments).

**Next:** turn the accessibility service on and run the scam flow through a real messaging
app screen (react_navigate), and an Allow tap on the scam card.

## 2026-09-18 — Gate ported up to the Python gate; shared vectors run on the phone

**Subsystem:** E (Permissions / Security) — `gate/` only. No brain, provider or UI change.

**Why:** the gatellml research gate (Python) found and fixed ~20 defects today in two adversarial
rounds. The Kotlin port had the worst of them: it traced targets by **substring**
(`norm(a) !in requestNorm`), so a recipient that sits inside the one the user named passed —
`ce@example.com` for `alice@example.com`, a shorter number inside the number typed.

**What changed** (patch built and tested in gatellml's northstar-loop work, applied here):
- Whole-token tracing everywhere (`tracesToRequest`); `saidByUser` delegates to it.
- A second address hidden behind a traced one is refused; any-TLD and IPv4 host checks; `www.`
  is the same site (the 2026-08-27 on-device rule, kept).
- Default contracts for egress arguments the manifest never declared.
- Secret-leak check survives case, spacing, reversal, rot13, base64 (also with text in front),
  hex, percent-encoding, a dropped `sk-` prefix, and a split across two arguments.
- Bare numbers: an id must follow its noun or an id word ("file 13", "with ID 13"); a 1-3 digit
  number is never a person; a required recipient left empty names nobody.
- `TargetTraceable` contract; optional arguments (`optional_args`) and stringly nulls.
- **Kelvin-sign homoglyph guard** — see below.

**Shared vectors:** `app/src/test/resources/gate_vectors.json` (88 cases) is the same file the
Python gate runs. `SharedVectorsTest` (JVM) and new `SharedVectorsDeviceTest` (instrumented, reads
the same file via androidTest assets — `build.gradle.kts` sourceSets) must both agree with Python.

**Device verification (Galaxy A15, SM-S156V, Android 16):**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| unit suite (JVM) | 380/380 |
| shared vectors on the phone (`am instrument`) | first run **1 of 87 disagreed**; after fix **87/87 agree** (1 skipped: needs the Created origin, which phone tools do not use) |

The one on-device disagreement was real and invisible to the JVM: `mi\u212ae@example.com` (Kelvin
sign) was ALLOWED on the phone. Android's ICU regex treats `\w` as Unicode, read the whole address
and lowercased it to `mike@example.com`; the desktop JVM's ASCII `\w` had split it and blocked it
by accident. Fixed in `tracesToRequest`: a non-ASCII character that lowercases into ASCII never
traces. **PROVEN** on device for the gate's verdicts on these 88 cases.

**Not proven:** a live agent run through the brain with the new gate (the tool loop was not
exercised end to end today). Status for the full app path: **SOURCE-FIXED, GATE VERDICTS
DEVICE-VERIFIED, END-TO-END RUNTIME-UNPROVEN.**

**Install notes:** installed with `adb install -r` (same `legacyDebug` key as the 2.2.0 build on the
phone, so data and settings survive). Never use `connectedAndroidTest` on the daily phone — it
uninstalls the app afterwards. Play Protect holds a sideloaded install behind a dialog on the phone
("Send / Don't send"); `adb install` hangs silently until someone taps it.

**Next:** one live run of a sending task through the brain on the phone with the new gate
(e.g. "text <a named number> I'm late" allowed; a number inside it refused).

## 2026-09-07 — Confidence scoring + low_confidence_egress gate rule

**Source:** Reddit intel compiled from 3 active posts (r/AI_Agents 28 comments, r/LocalLLM 13 comments). Additional feedback since the 2026-09-05 entry:

- **clearingai (r/AI_Agents, fraud ops background):** "The gate will hold. The operator won't." Every manual review queue in payments history decayed — month one you read the card, month six you tap on reflex. Evolve from review-everything to risk scoring. Gate already has the features: tool + args + request source. Hard part is calibrating without usage data.
- **arthaudm (r/AI_Agents, builds mio):** Validated block-not-log and deterministic router. Asked how operator-tap scales with more tools. Still engaged — checked back Sep 7 asking about the tap flow.
- **Alternative models (r/LocalLLM):** Bonsai-9B_Q1_0 on Motorola Edge 2024 (8GB, 3-4 tok/s decode). Needle2 as dedicated tool-calling model. PrismML 4B binary/ternary Qwen variant that might fit Galaxy A15.
- **SMS pin → clipboard** concrete demand from r/LocalLLM. Ultra already has SMS + clipboard tools.

**What was built:**

The observation infrastructure — every fact the agent reads now carries a source and a confidence level, and the gate tracks them per-episode.

New files:
- `gate/Fact.kt` — data class: `tool`, `source: Source`, `confidence: Confidence`, `timestamp`. Source is one of SYSTEM_API, ACCESSIBILITY_TREE, OPERATOR_CONFIRMATION, USER_REQUEST. Confidence is HIGH or LOW. Tree = LOW by construction. System APIs = HIGH. Confidence decays: a HIGH fact older than 120s becomes LOW.
- `gate/ObservationLog.kt` — per-episode store. Append-only within a request, queries for HIGH/LOW counts, summary for logcat.

Modified files:
- `gate/Gate.kt` — Episode now holds an `ObservationLog`. User request recorded as HIGH on creation. `observeTool(tool, summary)` tags by source. `observeOperatorConfirmation(tool)` records the operator's tap as HIGH.
- `agent/Brain.kt` — every tool execution in the cloud loop, local loop, recipe loop, and operator-confirm flow calls `episode.observeTool()`. Operator confirmation calls `episode.observeOperatorConfirmation()`. End-of-run logs the observation summary.

**Gate rule: `low_confidence_egress`**

The first enforcement rule built on top of the observation data. Before any egress tool (sms_send, open_url, web_search), the gate checks: did the agent gather any HIGH confidence tool observations, or only screen reads?

- Only tree reads (LOW) → **BLOCKED**, confirmable. Operator can verify and approve.
- At least one system API result (HIGH) → pass.
- Operator already confirmed something this episode → pass.
- No tool observations yet (just the user request) → pass. Don't block before the agent has gathered info.

Implementation: `ObservationLog` gained `toolObservations()`, `hasHighToolObservation()`, `hasLowToolOnly()` — all exclude the USER_REQUEST so the user's inherent HIGH doesn't mask a tree-only run. The check lives in `Gate.enforceCall()` alongside taint_egress, and `low_confidence_egress` is in the confirmable set.

**Device verification:**

| Test | Observations | Result |
|---|---|---|
| battery → web_search | 2 HIGH, 0 LOW | ALLOWED |
| clock screen read → web_search | 1 HIGH (user), 1 LOW (tree) | **BLOCKED** low_confidence_egress |
| battery → web_search (mixed) | 2 HIGH, 0 LOW | ALLOWED |

**Test suite:** 313/313 (was 262). New tests:
- `FactTest` — 18 tests: source classification, confidence decay, stale decay, sourceOf mapping for all tool categories
- `ObservationLogTest` — 21 tests: empty, HIGH/LOW recording, mixed, operator, user request, stale decay, summary, truncation, toolObservations exclusion, hasHighToolObservation, hasLowToolOnly (with tree-only, empty, system API, operator confirm, stale decay)
- `GateTest` — grew by 12: Episode observation tracking (6) + low_confidence_egress gate (6: blocks tree-only, passes with system API, passes with mixed, passes with no observations, cleared by operator confirm, doesn't apply to read tools)

**Status:** RUNTIME-PROVEN. Gate rule blocks egress when agent acts on screen reads alone, passes when system API data is present.

**Also built this session:**

- **SMS verification code auto-extract** (`SmsCodeDetector.kt`) — deterministic regex, no LLM. Notification listener detects incoming SMS with 4-8 digit codes near verification keywords, copies to clipboard, shows a toast. Off by default, Settings toggle added. 19 unit tests. Total 332.
- **Out-of-band verification for device toggles** — `verifyAction()` now covers WiFi (WifiManager.isWifiEnabled), Bluetooth (BluetoothAdapter.isEnabled), DND (NotificationManager.currentInterruptionFilter), and volume (AudioManager.getStreamVolume). Each queries the system API after the toggle and reports VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED. Caught a real bug on device: model sends `{"level": 0.5}` but tool expects `{"percent": 50}`.

- **Event trigger framework** (`EventTrigger.kt`) — generic system for deterministic reactions to phone events. Triggers are pure functions: notification in, action out. SmsCodeTrigger refactored out of UltraNotificationService into this framework. Failing triggers don't break the chain. 7 unit tests. Total 339.
- **Gemma 4 E2B added to local model presets** — 2.8B param, Q4_K_M quant (3.3GB). Newer architecture than Gemma 3 1B with better reasoning. Needs 6GB+ RAM so won't fit Galaxy A15 4GB, but available for higher-end devices. URL verified, file size confirmed.

**Model research completed:**
- Bonsai-1.7B Q1_0 (248 MB) and Bonsai-4B Q1_0 (572 MB) — incredible size-to-param ratio, but require PrismML's fork of llama.cpp. Ultra's JNI build uses standard llama.cpp. Not added to PRESETS — users would download weights that fail to load.
- Gemma 4 E2B smallest quant (IQ2_M) is 2.29 GB — still too big for Galaxy A15 4GB target. Q4_K_M at 3.3 GB added for 6GB+ devices.
- Bonsai models are the path forward for 4GB phones IF we switch to PrismML's llama.cpp fork. That's a JNI build change, not a preset change.

**EventTriggerTest fixed:** reflection used `field.get(null)` on an instance field — Kotlin `object` properties are instance fields, not static. Changed to `field.get(EventTrigger)`. TestContext.java removed (test uses `ContextWrapper(null)`).

- **Gate audit log** (`GateAuditLog.kt`) — JSONL file on device, one line per gate decision. Fields: timestamp, tool name, outcome (ALLOWED/BLOCKED/OVERRIDDEN), rule triggered, observation counts (high/low, tool-only high, tool-only low-only). No args, no message content, no PII — safe for public sharing. All three gate checkpoints (cloud, local, recipe) plus operator overrides log here. FileProvider added to manifest for share intent. Export button in Settings bundles the log with a device fingerprint header (RAM MB, Android SDK version, device manufacturer+model). 4 unit tests. Total 343.

- **Risk scoring scaffold** (`gate/RiskScorer.kt`) — 0-100 risk score per gate decision. Four signal components:
  - Effect tier (0-40): EGRESS=40, MUTATE=20, RESOLVE=10, READ=0
  - Observation quality (0-25): tree-only=25, no tool obs=5, has HIGH=0
  - Taint exposure (0-25): secret found in egress args=25, else 0
  - Argument traceability (0-20): untraced args (length>5, not in user request) — 1 untraced=10, 2+=20

  Score doesn't block anything — existing rules still govern enforcement. Score is attached to `Gate.Verdict`, written to every audit log entry under a `"risk"` JSON object with `total`, `effect`, `obs`, `taint`, `trace` fields. All 8 audit log call sites in Brain.kt pass the score through. Conservative defaults — the whole point is to collect real data via the audit log export, then calibrate thresholds before the score becomes enforcement. 14 tests (RiskScorerTest.kt). Total 357.

- **System event triggers** — `EventTrigger` extended with `SystemTrigger` interface for broadcast-based events. Six built-in:
  - `battery_low` (ACTION_BATTERY_LOW) — toasts current battery percentage
  - `battery_ok` (ACTION_BATTERY_OKAY) — toasts recovery
  - `charging_state` (POWER_CONNECTED/DISCONNECTED) — toasts plug/unplug
  - `screen_state` (SCREEN_ON/SCREEN_OFF) — toasts screen state
  - `headphones` (HEADSET_PLUG) — toasts connect/disconnect
  - `app_install` (PACKAGE_ADDED/PACKAGE_REMOVED) — toasts app name

  Receivers registered in `AgentBackgroundService`, cleaned up on destroy. Off by default — Settings toggle "System event triggers". Each trigger checks `UltraPrefs.systemTriggers()` before firing. Charger connect/disconnect RUNTIME-PROVEN on device. All 6 receivers confirmed registered via logcat. 12 tests. Total 369.

**PrismML llama.cpp fork evaluation (research, not code):**
- Fork: `PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp`, branch `prism`. Tracks upstream with low-bit quant kernels added.
- Enables binary/ternary quantization (Q1_0, Q2_0) for Bonsai models.
- **Galaxy A15 targets:** Bonsai-4B Q1_0 at 572 MB, Ternary-Bonsai-1.7B Q2_0 at 442 MB — both fit 4GB RAM.
- Android NDK build documented in `docs/android.md`, same CMake shape as upstream.
- C API unchanged — `LlmNative` JNI bindings should work without modification.
- **Risk:** ggml binary incompatibility — fork's README warns against mixing with stock builds. Standard GGUF models (Gemma 3 1B) should still load since fork tracks upstream, but needs verification.
- **Risk:** fork maintenance — if PrismML stops rebasing, Ultra is pinned to stale llama.cpp. Ternary support is partially landing in mainline already.
- **Recommendation:** side-branch build, verify both Gemma 3 1B Q4_K_M (regression) and Bonsai-4B Q1_0 (new), swap if both pass.

- **Risk-based auto-approve** — when a gate decision is confirmable AND risk score ≤ 15, auto-approve instead of blocking. Addresses clearingai's feedback ("the gate will hold, the operator won't") and arthaudm's scaling question. Implementation:
  - `Gate.kt` — `Verdict` gained `autoApproved: Boolean`, `AUTO_APPROVE_THRESHOLD = 15`. `enforceCall()` returns auto-approved verdicts for low-risk confirmable violations.
  - `GateAuditLog.kt` — `AUTO_APPROVED` added to `Outcome` enum.
  - `Brain.kt` — all 3 audit log call sites (recipe, local, cloud) emit `AUTO_APPROVED` outcome and `UltraGate` logcat line when auto-approve fires.
  - Threshold of 15 covers READ (effect=0) and RESOLVE (effect=10) with small observation gap. Never covers EGRESS (effect=40+) or MUTATE+untraced (30+). Non-confirmable rules (taint_egress, undeclared_tool, spoof_check) can never auto-approve.
  - 7 new tests in GateTest.kt: low-risk READ auto-approves, MUTATE doesn't, EGRESS doesn't, taint never, undeclared never, boundary (risk=15 passes, risk=25 blocks), high obs lowers risk.

  Total tests: 376. Status: SOURCE-FIXED, TEST-PROVEN. Runtime proof requires an agent conversation that triggers a low-risk confirmable gate decision — the logcat marker is `UltraGate: AUTO-APPROVE <tool> (risk=<n>)`.

**Open:**
- Auto-approve RUNTIME-UNPROVEN — needs agent conversation on device to hit a low-risk confirmable gate path
- Risk scoring threshold calibration — blocked on real community usage data from gate audit log exports
- PrismML JNI build swap — research done, side-branch build needed to verify standard model regression + Bonsai loading

## 2026-09-05 — External design input: confidence-scored observations (donk8r, r/AI_Agents)

**Source:** Multi-round Reddit thread on r/AI_Agents post. donk8r builds mio (AI
coworker in Slack) and has shipped the same block-not-log pattern. Three rounds
of increasingly specific feedback, the last one implementation-level.

**Key design ideas (all from donk8r, none implemented yet):**

1. **Attach confidence to observations, not calls.** Currently Gate.kt checks
   per-call against the manifest. donk8r's proposal: each fact the agent observes
   carries `{value, source, confidence, timestamp}`. Battery=80 from
   BatteryManager → high confidence. "Post published" from accessibility tree →
   low. The policy becomes one rule ("high-privilege actions require
   high-confidence recent facts") instead of per-tool logic.

2. **Tree = low by construction.** Anything the accessibility tree told you is
   low confidence by default. This is a single rule that covers hostile-app
   scenarios without enumerating cases. Better than maintaining a trust list.

3. **Confidence decay.** A high-confidence battery read from 10 minutes ago is
   not a current fact. Timestamp every observation; the gate compares against the
   age of the request. Prevents stale observations authorizing fresh privileged
   actions — a production bug that passes unit tests because tests run fast.

4. **Composition resistance as a side effect.** If tree observations are low
   confidence and low confidence blocks escalation to high-privilege tools, the
   clipboard-read → browser-open → exfiltrate chain gets blocked without taint
   tracking. The composition problem and verifier overlap problem collapse into
   one mechanism via confidence scoring.

5. **Ranking shuffle validates model-external gate.** Defenses that held on one
   model family broke on another in the 112-model gate sweep. A gate that sits
   outside the model and checks a manifest holds regardless of which model
   produced the call — the shuffle is the argument for the architecture.

6. **Operator-tap must be a distinct confidence source (4th follow-up).**
   The ActionGate card is a tree element — the operator taps it through the
   same accessibility surface as hostile apps. If tree = low by default, then
   operator approval = low by default, silently breaking the one flow that
   carries the most trust. Fix: an explicit operator tap on the gate card is
   not "the tree said something" — it's a human physically confirming within
   the timeout window. That should be its own confidence event type sitting
   above tree-default. One more event type, not a rule exception.

**User feature request (Odd_Cauliflower_8004, r/LocalLLM):**
- **Automatic SMS trigger:** wants Ultra to auto-detect incoming SMS
  verification codes and copy to clipboard without being asked. The
  accessibility service already sees notifications and SMS + clipboard
  tools exist. Missing piece: event-driven trigger layer with permission
  gating. Plumbing exists, policy question remains.

**Implementation path (not started):**
- New `Fact` data class: `value`, `source: Source`, `confidence: Level`,
  `timestamp: Long`
- Tag observations at source — BatteryManager/CameraManager → HIGH, tree → LOW
- Gate.kt: one new rule — high-privilege actions require HIGH + recent
- Confidence decay mirrors the 120s timeout pattern already in ActionGate.kt
- Composition resistance falls out without separate taint tracking
- ActionGate operator-tap: new `Source.OPERATOR_CONFIRMATION` type → HIGH
  confidence, distinct from `Source.ACCESSIBILITY_TREE` → LOW
- **Critical:** the high-confidence source for operator confirmation must be the
  `onClick` callback in Ultra's own process — never the tree reporting the card
  looks confirmed. If the tree read-back is the confidence source, verifier
  overlap is rebuilt one level deeper. (donk8r's closing note, 5th follow-up)

**Status:** DESIGN INPUT ONLY. Not validated against the codebase beyond
confirming the current gate is per-call (Gate.kt) and some tools already verify
out-of-band (battery, flashlight). No code changes made.

## Current State

**Last updated:** 2026-09-07 (Confidence scoring + low_confidence_egress gate rule; 332 tests)

**App status:** Agent Ultra is a native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose Android app in `ultra-native/`. Version `2.0.0-native`, minSdk 26, targetSdk 35, arm64-v8a only. Cloud brain runs on **Venice** (`llama-3.3-70b`); an on-device Gemma 3 1B model handles the offline and fast paths. 30 tools, all declared in the policy gate manifest. Hands-free assist sessions and named recipes ship as of Session 16. Device regression: **8/8 PASS**, unit tests **332/332**, including four real screen captures committed as fixtures (`amazon-search`, `hn-front`, `native-clock`, `native-settings`) so perception can be developed and regression-tested without a phone. Release builds are **R8-minified** (8,665,752 bytes); `proguard-rules.pro` keeps the JNI and service symbols, so it is not optional reading before touching either.

**Published:** source is private at `github.com/dafarusd/Ultra-Agent` (branch `native`). The public face is `github.com/dafarusd/Ultra-Agent-Release` — APK, README, and the site at `dafarusd.github.io/Ultra-Agent-Release`. Anything written there is public copy: read `~/vault/publishing/CLAUDE.md` first and log it after.

**The Expo / React Native app at the repo root is superseded.** `src/`, `app/`, `components/`, `server/`, `android/`, `ios/`, `app.json`, and `eas.json` belong to the old build. Nothing on the active path reads them — do not fix bugs there. The "Local Build Reference" section at the bottom of this file documents the **old** EAS/Expo build and applies only to that dead tree. The `BRAIN_*`, `REPLIT_*`, and `*_PROOF.md` files in the repo root are from the same era.

**LAW:** The brain is the product. Tools are infrastructure. Everything exists so the agent can DO whatever the user asks. If the brain can't reason, nothing else matters. Never sacrifice brain intelligence for tool plumbing.

### Architecture (native)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `agent/Brain.kt` | 12-turn cloud tool loop, local-first router, task-memory hints, streaming |
| `agent/Tools.kt` | 31-tool dispatcher; failures start with `Error:` |
| `agent/ScreenStructure.kt` | rebuilds the a11y tree and groups labels into list items |
| `agent/Recipes.kt` | named, replayable tool sequences; user-attested on replay |
| `VoiceActivity.kt` | hands-free assist session — listen, run, speak back |
| `ui/Speaker.kt` | on-device text-to-speech with logged start/done |
| `agent/AgentController.kt` | In-process device layer — a11y, launch, toggles, SMS, clipboard, location |
| `agent/ReActNavigator.kt` | perceive → think → act → verify UI navigation, 15-iteration budget |
| `gate/` | Kotlin port of the gatellml policy gate — origins, contracts, manifest, runtime, observations |
| `local/` | llama.cpp JNI shim + Gemma 3 1B engine, model download and load |
| `provider/` | OpenAI-compatible client (streaming + non-streaming), provider config |
| `data/` | Room — conversations, messages, task memory (DB v2) |
| `ui/` | Chat, drawer, settings, voice input, quick actions |
| `AgentAccessibilityService.java` | The a11y service (still Java — ported verbatim, not rewritten) |

### What is PROVEN on device

- Full loop: model → tool → device → answer. Battery, flashlight, clipboard round trip, notes on disk, app launch, URL open, web search with real content.
- Policy gate blocks untraced actions live, and the confirm channel resolves them on an operator tap (gatellml SPEC §2 R4). Unit tests 14/14.
- On-device model answers with the network fully dead — airplane mode, Wi-Fi off, no SIM.
- Local-first router runs simple device commands with zero cloud calls.
- Task memory injects a hint on a repeat request and the model follows it.
- Deterministic post-action verification via a live window scan.
- Conversations survive force-stop.
- Streaming answers render live; tool-call turns retract the bubble.
- Hands-free: spoken words → on-device transcription → tool call → spoken answer. Proven acoustically with no human in the loop, and **ear-verified by the owner on 2026-08-28** ("i heard it, it works").
- Ultra is selectable as the device's Digital assistant app (Settings → Apps → Default apps → Digital assistant app → **Other apps** → Agent Ultra). Press-and-hold Side button opens a listening session, including from a dark screen.
- The answer is still spoken with the app in the background: backgrounded to the launcher after transcription, the tool still ran and `SPEAK START` still fired.
- The on-device model is switchable in Settings — five verified presets plus a custom GGUF URL.
- Recipes: a two-tool run saved by name and replayed from a fresh conversation, gate-approved.
- Deep perception: an Amazon results page read across 20 screens and returned as **grouped items** — product name paired with its own price, straight from the accessibility tree rather than inferred. The same request returned "not available" two sessions ago.
- Task memory recalls across rewordings, stores the arguments, and refuses to record a task that failed.

### What is PARTIALLY PROVEN

- **Voice input with a real human voice** — proven only against a synthetic voice played through a laptop speaker, where transcription is phrase-dependent ("what is the battery level" works, "what is the capital of Japan" returns NO_MATCH). The owner's own voice has not been measured across a range of phrasings.
- **Flashlight** — the CameraManager API reports success. This Samsung has no torch-state dump, so there is no proof the light physically came on.

### What is NOT working

- Navigator step efficiency: the budget-exhaustion case is fixed (a goal visible on screen ends the run without a model turn). Step counts inside unfamiliar apps are still model-tuned.
- The 1B model echoes the prompt's few-shot examples as chatter before its real answer. The parser holds; the logs are ugly.
- Cross-task contamination still triggers gate confirmation cards mid-suite. This is by design — the operator resolves it — but it interrupts unattended runs.
- Dead code: `Brain.kt` builds a local-route prompt at line 222 that line 243 immediately overwrites.

### Build, install, and test

```
cd ~/projects/Audit-Discuss-Build/ultra-native
./gradlew assembleDebug
tools/install.sh
```

The install script handles the Play Protect "Don't send" dialog, re-enables the accessibility service, and launches the app. It prints the installed `versionName` and confirms the service bound — read both before testing, because a silent no-op install has cost a test run before.

- Proof suite: `tools/suite.sh` — sends each task, waits for the brain's `RUN COMPLETE` marker, saves logcat and a screenshot per task.
- Tap by visible text: `tools/uitap.sh "Send"`.
- Logs: `adb logcat -s UltraBrain:* UltraGate:* UltraLlm:* AgentA11y:*`.
- Compose screens dump cleanly with `uiautomator`; the old RN screens did not.
- `adb shell input text` needs `%s` for spaces.

**Wireless ADB:** `<device-ip>`. `adb tcpip 5555` does not survive a phone reboot — re-pair through Android's Wireless debugging screen when `adb connect` is refused, then target with `-s <ip>:<port>` to dodge the mDNS ghost entry. Do not test `wifi_toggle` or `airplane_mode` over wireless ADB; it kills the connection.

**Backup:** USB drive `agent-ultra` at `<backup-mount>`, bare repo `agent-ultra.git`, remote name `usb`. Both `main` and `native` are pushed and tracked. Plugging the drive in runs `<backup-script>` automatically; check `<backup-mount>/backup.log` for `exit: 0`.

### Privacy and safety, stated plainly

- **Whatever the agent reads goes to the cloud model.** Screen contents, SMS, contacts, notifications and location all travel to Venice as tool results so the model can decide the next step. The gate's taint rule stops secrets leaving via *egress tools*; it does not and cannot stop the brain call itself.
- **The agent may only enter apps the owner has ticked** (Settings → WHERE THE AGENT MAY GO). Allowlist mode is the default from first launch and fails closed. A block-list mode exists, seeded from package-name hints, for anyone who wants the looser posture.
- **Messages, contacts and location are off by default** (Settings → PERSONAL DATA). They read Android's providers directly, so the app list does not cover them.
- **`react_navigate` taps that commit something now stop and ask** — pay, buy, order, confirm, submit, send, transfer, delete, subscribe, book and similar, on both indexed and coordinate taps. Ordinary taps run untouched by design. Typing is not gated; the button after it is.
- **Notification logging is off by default** and skips protected apps.
- Any force-stop silently disables the accessibility service — the agent's eyes and hands — and the header chip is the only signal.

### Known blockers and risks

- **Google Play accessibility policy.** Apps using AccessibilityService face extra scrutiny, and Android 17's Advanced Protection Mode may block non-tool accessibility apps entirely. Long-term distribution is uncertain. This has been open since Build 29 and is unresolved.
- **Accessibility service** must be re-enabled after every install. `tools/install.sh` does it.
- **Play Protect dialog** appears with variable delay and the script sometimes misses it. Verify the version actually changed before trusting a test.

## Active Decisions

Decisions that affect ongoing work. Update as decisions are made or reversed.

- **`ultra-native/` is the app.** The React Native tree is dead. No work goes into it.
- **Gradle is the build.** `./gradlew assembleDebug` on the Framework laptop, about a minute. EAS is gone, and with it the stale-native-code problem that blocked Sessions 5 through 12.
- **`Brain.kt` is the sole execution path**, ported from the proven `BrainExecutor.ts`: same prompt shape, first-balanced-JSON tool parsing, dynamic token budget (2000 / 1500 / 2500), push-once follow-through, same-tool-twice stuck stop, structured `[RESULT]` feedback.
- **No RN bridge and no HeadlessJS.** `AgentController` calls the accessibility service in-process. The Activity-backgrounding problem that forced HeadlessJS does not exist in the native build; `AgentBackgroundService` is a sticky foreground service started at app create to survive Samsung's background kill on this 3.5 GB device.
- **The gate is the enforcement layer.** `Gate.enforceCall` runs before every tool, deterministically, with no model judgment. The old "About to:" confirmation is UX only.
- **The gate manifest is deny-by-default.** A tool not declared in `assets/ultra.manifest.json` cannot run. Completeness is mandatory — an incomplete manifest makes the gate vacuous.
- **Blocks continue the episode.** A blocked call returns the gate's block message as the tool result and the loop keeps going. Traceability-class blocks are confirmable: the run pauses, the operator taps Confirm, and the target is minted user-attested for that episode. Taint, spoof, and undeclared blocks are never confirmable.
- **Cloud drives the tool loop; the on-device model is the offline brain and the fast path.** Measured, not assumed: Gemma 3 1B Q4_K_M runs at 10.1 tok/s on this phone — enough for single decisions, not for a reliable multi-step loop.
- **Local-first routing with a conservative classifier.** Simple device commands run on-device. Compound requests (`and`, `then`) and URL-like targets go straight to cloud — those were measured failures. A local miss escalates to cloud automatically.
- **The engine owns params, the model owns intent.** The 1B model emits tool names, not JSON, so `parseBareToolCall` shapes the parameters deterministically from the request. Few-shot examples in the local prompt are load-bearing; zero-shot picked the wrong tool.
- **History window is rebuilt fresh per request** — last 8 visible chat messages, 4 KB cap. Tool traces never enter it. This is the fix for Build 29's conversation bleed.
- **Live window scan is ground truth.** The event-sourced package tracker goes stale on service rebind. `getForegroundPackage()` rescans windows, and `app_launch` / `open_url` verify against it.
- **Duplicate calls are deduped.** The same tool with identical params right after a success gets "already done" feedback instead of re-firing.
- **Task memory is Room-backed (DB v2).** Successful tool sequences per normalized request, plus per-tool reliability counters. Hints are injected as a system message on a repeat request.
- **The provider is configured in Settings.** Base URL, key, and model are edited on the phone; saving bumps a `configVersion` key that rebuilds the Brain. A dev seed path still exists as a fallback: if no key is stored, `ProviderConfig` reads `Android/data/com.agent.ultra/files/ultra_provider.json` once. It is never consulted after a key is saved.
- **Cloud provider is Venice** (`https://api.venice.ai/api/v1`, `llama-3.3-70b`). Venice prepends its own ~1000-token system prompt unless `venice_parameters.include_venice_system_prompt` is false. Measured on llama-3.3-70b: with it on, prompt_tokens goes 26 → 1081 and the chat template breaks. `OpenAiClient` sends the flag for venice.ai hosts only.
- **Two-Claude workflow.** Chat Claude (claude.ai) = strategy, planning, architecture. Claude Code = execution, validation, commits. Solution files from Chat Claude are validated against the real codebase before applying.

## Session Log

<!-- Add new entries at the top. Most recent first. -->

### Session 16r — step-level action reliability (2026-08-29, branch `native`, Galaxy A15)

Owner: "fix this then. step-level action reliability is now the binding constraint."

#### The result

The same task that failed all session — open Chrome's History page from the three-dot menu — now completes.

```
before:  navigation incomplete after 15 steps: iteration budget exhausted
after:   Goal achieved after 4 steps: all 3 stages done
```

Chrome is showing the History page. Verified on the phone, not inferred from a log line.

#### The thing that made it findable

**The navigator never logged which action it chose.** Every failure looked the same from outside, and a bad choice was indistinguishable from a good choice executed badly. Adding one line — the action, and its outcome — turned four invisible bugs into four obvious ones inside a single run.

Worth generalising: **anything that decides on the agent's behalf has to say what it decided.** That is the same lesson as the 120-character tool-result cap in 16m, which hid four bugs for a day.

#### Four bugs

1. **The keyboard blocked everything.** `currentPackage` was set from any accessibility event, and the keyboard, status bar and notification shade all emit them. The policy gate then believed the agent was "in" `com.android.systemui`, which is on nobody's allowed list, so **every action after a keyboard appeared was refused**. Any task that typed could do nothing afterwards.

   The code already knew. It skipped *logging* systemui and the keyboard as a package change while still recording them as one — it recognised the case and then did the harmful thing anyway.

2. **An index was resolved against a fresh dump.** The model chose an index from the screen it was shown; the tap looked that index up in a newly taken dump. If an advert loaded or a page settled in between, index N was a different node and the agent confidently tapped the wrong thing. The label the model saw is now carried alongside the index, and a mismatch is refused rather than acted on.

   It fired on a real run: `NOT DONE: [15] is no longer on the screen — look at it again`. That is a wrong tap prevented.

3. **Taps were pixels, not nodes.** A coordinate tap misses a node behind an overlay, one that has moved, or one only partly on screen. The node is asked to activate now, through the same path the app uses for a real touch, with the gesture kept as a fallback for views that handle touch while reporting themselves unclickable.

4. **Typed text was silently corrupted.** `chrome://history/` went in; the field held `chrome//history/`. The colon was gone, the page failed to load, **the type reported success**, and the run spent its remaining budget wondering why the site would not open. The field is read back before enter is pressed now, and a mismatch is reported instead of committed.

   This one is a safety matter as much as a reliability one: pressing enter on text a field did not accept is how an agent searches for, or sends, something nobody asked for.

#### A regression made and fixed in the same pass

Preferring the **topmost** window — so an open menu is described rather than the page behind it — picked systemui the moment a keyboard appeared. Device furniture (status bar, navigation bar, keyboard) is never the task, and is now excluded everywhere the foreground app is decided.

The allowlist is what caught it: every action came back `GATE: BLOCKED pkg=com.android.systemui`. The safety model did its job on a bug introduced ten minutes earlier.

#### Honest scope

Chrome's overflow menu turned out **not** to be a separate window (layer 0 throughout), so the topmost-window work was not what fixed this task. It is still correct for dialogs and popups that are separate windows, and it is unproven for those.

#### Harness note

`tools/ask.sh` does not escape quotes: a task containing an apostrophe fails silently with `no closing quote` and produces no log at all. Cost two runs before it was spotted.

#### Open

- Items 2 (tasks that cross apps) and 3 (undo) remain untouched.
- The demo now has a genuine multi-step task that works end to end and can be filmed.

### Session 16q — planning with checkpoints (2026-08-29, branch `native`, Galaxy A15)

Owner: "do 4, the planning with checkpoints."

#### What was wrong

The loop was purely reactive: look at the screen, ask the model for one action, do it, repeat until a fixed budget runs out. It had no idea whether it was getting closer. Two failures came straight out of that:

- **The model spent turns deciding whether it had finished.** "Go to google.com" loaded the page on step one and then deliberated for fourteen more. That was patched in 16i by checking the screen for a domain name — a fix that only works for goals naming a website.
- **A stuck run looked exactly like a working one** until the budget ended, and then all it could say was `iteration budget exhausted`.

#### What it does now (PROVEN on the phone)

The model writes a plan: 2–4 stages, each with the text that will be on screen when that stage is done. **The model owns the plan** — how to approach a goal is intent. **The engine owns the checking** — it verifies checkpoints, counts the budget and decides when to replan, because a model asked "are you finished?" says yes more readily than it should.

```
PLAN 2 stages, 7 steps each: Tap Customize and control Chrome => Chrome menu
                           | Tap History => History
stage 1/2 reached at step 1
REPLAN at step 8: 2 stages
plan abandoned at step 13, continuing on the goal
navigation incomplete after 15 steps — reached 1 of 2 stages,
  stuck on: Tap "History" from menu (the plan was abandoned before the end)
```

**That last line is the deliverable.** It replaces "iteration budget exhausted", which told the owner only that time ran out and told the brain nothing it could act on.

#### Three things the first live runs taught

Each was a real reply from the model on this phone, not something imagined:

1. **"EXPECT: none"** — written exactly as the prompt asked, and it became a gate no screen could ever open. The run pushed against it for a whole stage budget. An uncheckable stage is guidance now: it passes as soon as an action moves the screen.
2. **Prose instead of a label** — one stage expected `The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: La Tour Eiffel [tuʁ ɛfɛl]) is an iro`. That is a description of the page, not text printed on it. An expectation over 60 characters is a description and is not treated as checkable.
3. **Two stages with the SAME expectation** — "New tab", which the screen already showed. Both completed instantly without the menu ever opening, and the stage that mattered became unreachable. **A checkpoint has to mark a change**: an expectation already true when its stage begins is demoted to guidance.

The engine cannot fix a bad plan. It can refuse to be fooled by one.

#### The honest outcome

**The machinery is proven and the task still fails.** The navigator cannot find and tap Chrome's three-dot menu. That is a step-level action failure, not a planning failure — and planning is what made it legible. Before, the same run said "budget exhausted"; now it names the stage it could not get past.

This is worth stating plainly: item 4 improved the diagnosis, not the success rate. The next real gain is at the level of a single action, not the plan around it.

#### Safety of the change

Planning can never make a run worse than not planning. Every failure path — no reply, an unparseable reply, an empty plan — falls back to the single-goal loop that ran before.

#### Test suite

**134/134.** `NavPlanTest` covers parsing, checking, budget and reporting; `NavPlanRealRepliesTest` covers the three real replies above verbatim.

#### Harness note

`tools/ask.sh` does not escape quotes, so a task containing an apostrophe fails silently with `no closing quote` from `adb shell input text` and no log at all. Cost two runs before it was spotted. **Avoid apostrophes in task text, or fix the script.**

#### Open

- Items 2 (tasks that cross apps) and 3 (undo) are untouched.
- Step-level action reliability is now the binding constraint on multi-step tasks, ahead of anything in the plan layer.

### Session 16p — remembering where the controls are (2026-08-29, branch `native`, Galaxy A15)

Owner: "keep going on 1, remember where the controls are."

#### Answering the question asked alongside it

**The tests are not part of the app.** Verified against the shipped APK: zero test classes, zero fixtures. The 464 KB of captured screens and 88 KB of tests live in `app/src/test/`, a source set Gradle compiles only for the JVM test task and never packages. The APK is 8,682,136 bytes and contains none of it. They are development tooling, not product.

#### What was wrong

The navigator hands the model a freshly numbered list of everything on screen and asks it to pick an index. Those numbers mean nothing beyond the moment — the same search box is `[3]` now and `[11]` after the page shifts — so every visit costs a model call to find a control the agent has already found a hundred times.

Worse: typing with no index tapped **"the first editable node on screen"**, which is a guess, and wrong on any page with two boxes.

#### What it does now (PROVEN on the phone)

A control has an identity the app gave it. `url_bar` is the address bar today, tomorrow, and after an update moves it down the page.

```
screen .../773d46c9b25327b7: 6 on screen, 6 remembered, 6 usable
typed into known control #url_bar

screen .../d40543a58faf33b7: 7 on screen, 6 remembered, 7 usable
typed into known control #url_bar
```

The second run is a **different website**, and therefore a different screen, and the controls still carried over.

#### The app-level row, which took a second pass

The first attempt remembered controls per screen and never recalled them in a browser. A browser's fingerprint includes the ids of whatever page is loaded, so **every website is a different screen** — which is correct, and which meant the toolbar was relearned on every visit to every site. The address bar is the same control on all of them.

Controls seen anywhere in an app now accumulate under an app-level row (`pkg/*`) and are available everywhere in it; the screen row holds what is specific to that page. Capped at 80 per app.

#### Privacy — the point, not a footnote

**Only the view id and the kind of control are stored. Never the label, never the contents.**

A button's label is user content: "Send to Mum", "Pay £240.00", a contact's name. Writing that to disk would turn a structural memory into a record of what the user does. A view id is a constant a developer typed into a layout file — it says *where* the button is, not what it says.

- A control with no view id is **skipped** rather than remembered by its label. It stays perfectly usable in the moment through the ordinary indexed list; this is only about what survives to the next visit.
- Content dressed up as an id — the product codes and story numbers found in 16o — is rejected by the same test.
- The cost is that web pages, which rarely give real ids, mostly cannot have their controls remembered. That is the right trade.

There are tests holding this line specifically: a screen containing "Send to Mum" and "240.00" must produce a stored value containing neither.

#### Also

`add` chose `address_bar_container`, because "address" starts with "add", while the actual add button sat in the same list. Whole-word matching now runs before prefix matching.

The tree dump carries `editable` and `enabled`, and the flat dump carries `vid`, so a remembered control can be resolved to a tap without depending on an index.

Room v5 → v6, real migration. **Suite 113/113.**

#### Open

- A navigation run in Chrome still exhausted its step budget on a search task. Remembering the control removed one guess; the loop's step-by-step reasoning is item 4 of the plan and is untouched.
- Items 2 (tasks that cross apps) and 3 (undo) are untouched.

### Session 16o — native apps verified, and the agent starts remembering screens (2026-08-29, branch `native`, Galaxy A15)

Owner: "do 5 then start on 1".

#### Item 5 — native apps (PROVEN)

| Screen | Nodes | Carrying a view id |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon search, in Chrome | 1,907 | 0 usable — 1,096 anonymous `android.view.View` |
| Samsung Clock | 132 | 84 |
| Settings app list | 107 | 56 |

Template matching needed **no changes** to work on native: 4 alarms out of the Clock and 12 entries out of Settings, correctly grouped first try.

The real find is that **native apps name their own fields**. The Clock exposes `alarm_item_time`, `alarm_item_ampm`, `alarm_list_alarm_name`. Running a regex over "8:15" to decide it is a time, when the app has already said so, is the same mistake as rebuilding page structure from text statistics — which this file has now had three times.

A label's view id is its field name when the id means something. Ids naming a slot rather than a meaning are rejected (`text1`, `container`, `row`, `tv`) — a field called "container" is worse than an unnamed one. The text-pattern classifier stays as the fallback and is what still runs on web content.

An alarm now reaches the model as:

```
alarm_list_alarm_name=Morning Alarm, alarm_time=8:15, alarm_ampm=AM,
alarm_list_alert_date=Sun, Aug 30
```

#### Item 1 — the agent remembers what a screen is (PROVEN, first increment)

Every read was done from scratch, and the answer thrown away. The thousandth visit to a page worked as hard as the first, and **the same page came back as 130, then 126, then 123 records inside one read.**

A screen now has an identity that survives its content changing — the vocabulary of view ids and widget kinds on it, never its text. What was learned is kept and recalled.

```
learned screen com.android.chrome/773d46c9b25327b7 (IDS) 31 records, fields=[points,rank]
structure: recalled template, 60 records
```

Recall was proven **across separate runs**, not just within one.

**Structure only.** A memory row is the shape of a page and the *names* of its fields, never a value. Nothing about what was read, bought or messaged is persisted. Room v4 → v5, real migration, table capped at 300 rows.

#### Five bugs found while proving it — three of them mine, from earlier today

1. **A fingerprint built on view ids had to reject ids that are content.** Amazon exposes product codes and UUIDs as ids; Hacker News exposes story numbers. They change every visit, so the same page would never match itself — and as a field name one would have reached the model as `49417298: 130 points`.

2. **Rows were ordered by screen position.** Bounds are only trustworthy for what is visible; off-screen rows report stale or identical tops. A 60-row page sorted into 14 correct pairs followed by 17 scores with no headlines beside them, and the pairing collapsed. **The tree arrives in reading order, and reading order is what a list means.**

3. **Pairing demanded perfect alternation** down the whole list, so one job post with no score aborted every pair on the page. It pairs greedily now and is believed when a majority of the list pairs up — a property of the list, not of one lucky row.

4. **The shape signature counted distinct child kinds**, so `View{TextView}` matched a wrapper holding one line and a story row holding four. 153 tiny wrappers then outweighed the real stories and the read collapsed to nothing structured at all. Counts are banded: tolerant of four fields beside five, decisive between one and four.

5. **Recall returned a worse answer than computing fresh.** It skipped the widening that pairs split table rows, so recalled stories came back with their scores stripped. **A shortcut that changes the answer is not a shortcut.**

Numbers 3 and 4 were regressions introduced by the template work in 16n and **not caught because Hacker News was never re-tested after that change**. The store page got better while the aggregator silently got worse.

#### The fixture suite is the durable win

Every captured page is now a test. `hn-front` joins `amazon-search` and the two native fixtures, and `AllFixturesTest` reads all four, asserting that stories carry their own score, products carry a price, alarms carry the app's own time field, and **no page returns a row holding a single stray value**.

That last one is the assertion that would have caught both regressions the minute they landed instead of two device installs later.

#### Test suite

**101/101.**

#### Open

- The plan's items 2 (tasks that cross apps), 3 (undo) and 4 (planning with checkpoints) are untouched.
- Screen memory currently only recalls the record template. The next increment is remembering *where the controls are*, which is what turns a fifteen-step navigation into a lookup.
- `restoreScroll` still reports partial restores on some store pages.

### Session 16n — the store test, and reading a page by its own template (2026-08-29, branch `native`, Galaxy A15)

Owner: "run the store page test. im talking about leaps in advancement, magnatudes"

#### What the store test showed

The price-ambiguity work from 16k held up immediately and it matters:

```
price: $25.98
price: List:$35.99
prices shown: $25.98, $35.99 (more than one — do not assume which is charged)
```

That is the difference between the agent knowing it pays $25.98 and confidently reporting $35.99.

Everything else was bad. **18 rows from 11 screens** of a search page, mostly orphaned rating fragments with no product name attached:

```
2. Rated 4.4 out of 5 stars by 88506 reviews.   ← not a product
```

#### The root cause, and the leap

**The accessibility tree carries `className` and `viewIdResourceName`, and the service threw both away** before `ScreenStructure` ever saw them. The page was telling us its structure and we discarded it, then reconstructed it from text statistics — scoring containers by how uniform their children looked. Every fix since has been a patch on that guess, including two in the last two sessions.

The service now emits `cls` and `vid` in short form. The reader groups nodes by a **structural signature** — what kinds of thing a node is made of — and takes the largest repeating group. That is the page saying which nodes are the same kind of thing rather than the reader inferring it.

#### Three corrections that only a real page could produce

A real tree was captured from the phone and committed as `app/src/test/resources/amazon-search.json` — 1,907 nodes. **All three of these were invisible in synthetic trees**, and the fixture means this can now be developed and regression-tested without a device.

1. **Chrome exposes web content as 1,096 identical `android.view.View` nodes with no view ids.** A class-based signature is decisive in a native app and nearly useless on a web page. The signature had to become a **set** of child kinds, tolerant of a card carrying a "Limited time deal" badge its neighbour does not.

2. **Scoring `count × median size` picked the rating widget** — twenty-four of them, tidy and identical, nested inside the product cards that were the answer. Every record came back as "4.3 out of 5 stars" and nothing else. Scoring by **total text covered** picks the outermost repeating unit, which is the thing a person would point at and call a result.

3. **One card matches the template at several nesting levels**, so a product came back three times, and not as exact repeats — an outer layer picks up a "More like this" heading the inner one does not. A record whose content is contained in another record's is that record seen from further in; the outer one is kept.

#### Measured

On the captured fixture: **19 distinct products, 22 of 27 records carrying a price, 22 carrying a rating.** Previously: 24 records that were a rating and nothing else.

On the phone, the answer came back as:

```
1. TAGRY Bluetooth Headphones - $25.98, $35.99
2. TALIX H30 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones - $69.99
3. Sony WH-CH520 Wireless On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones - $38.00, $69.99
4. KVIDIO Bluetooth Headphones - $18.96, $24.56

Note: the prices shown are the current price and the list price, but it's not
clear which one is the actual price charged.
```

**The model relayed the engine's ambiguity rather than picking one.** That is the designed behaviour surviving all the way from the tree to the answer, and it is the difference between an agent that could buy the right thing and one that guesses.

#### Scroll restore, second attempt

`restored 0/7 scrolls` on the store page: the node that scrolled forward refused `ACTION_SCROLL_BACKWARD` and the page stayed at the bottom. Restore now falls back to the plain gesture when the deep scroll refuses.

#### Test suite

**78/78.** New: template matching 5, real page 3. `unitTests.isReturnDefaultValues` is on, because the reader logs which method chose the records and `android.util.Log` throws in a JVM test otherwise — that log line is the only way to tell on a device whether the template match or the fallback ran.

#### Honest status

- Template matching, coverage scoring and containment: **PROVEN** on a real store page and on Hacker News.
- The fallback scorer is still in place for a tree with no class names, and is still what runs against a dump from an older build.
- Some products appear more than once, because the page genuinely shows them in several carousels. Not fixed, and probably not a defect.
- The navigator's app-drift detection remains **RUNTIME-UNPROVEN**.

### Session 16m — device verification, and the pairing that was never structural (2026-08-29, branch `native`, Galaxy A15)

Phone attached mid-session. Everything below is **PROVEN on hardware** unless it says otherwise.

#### Session 16k's scroll restore works, and the proof is better than the log line

```
deep scroll 1: +38 new (labels 178, items 60)
…
deep scroll 5: +39 new (labels 318, items 60)
deep read: restored 5/5 scrolls
```

The log line says `restored 5/5`. The real evidence is the **second** deep read in the same run reproducing the first read's scroll-by-scroll gains exactly — +38, +34, +35, +32, +39. That is only possible if the page went back to the top. Before this fix the second read would have started at the bottom and found nothing.

#### The pairing on Hacker News was never structural

Raising the tool-result log cap from 120 to 2000 characters made this visible for the first time. The old cap cut a structured read off at its header, so **the rows the model actually reasoned over had never once been looked at.**

What they contained:

```
1. 1.
   vote?id=49489057&how=up&goto=news
   Iceland votes on whether to restart talks on joining EU (bbc.com)
2. 120 points by tosh 1 hour ago | hide | 125 comments
   points: 120 points
```

**The title and the score are separate items.** Hacker News is a table where each story is two sibling rows. Container grouping returned them ungrouped, so the model was pairing a score to a headline **by adjacency** — the exact inference `ScreenStructure` exists to eliminate, still happening one level up.

The answers in 16j and 16l were correct. The mechanism behind them was not the one that was claimed. **The earlier "structured extraction, correct product↔price pairing" claim holds for card layouts and did not hold for table layouts.**

`mergeSplitRows` merges a pair only on strict evidence: the list alternates all the way down, every even row carrying no metadata field and every odd row carrying one. A product grid fails that test, because every card has a price. A list where only some rows are sponsored fails it too. **60 items became 30**, each carrying its own score.

#### Three more, all found by reading what the model was given

- **The rank marker won the title.** Every row read `1. 1.` with the headline demoted to a detail line. Title is now the first label that is not a bare ordinal; the ordinal is kept as its own `rank` field.
- **The score was named twice** — alone, and inside the whole subtext line. Only an exact superset is dropped, so a row with two genuinely different prices still keeps both.
- **`|` survived every filter.** The regex was correct; the label was not a plain pipe. The page wraps it in **non-breaking spaces**, which Java's `\s` does not match and Kotlin's `trim()` does not remove. Replaced with a character test that strips separators first and then asks whether anything alphanumeric is left — it cannot be fooled by whichever space character a page happens to use. Also drops bare query strings like `vote?id=…&how=up`.

Rows now reach the model like this:

```
1. Iceland votes on whether to restart talks on joining EU (bbc.com)
   rank: 1.
   bbc.com
   points: 130 points
   by / tosh / 1 hour ago / hide / 138 comments
```

Final answer: **10 stories, each with its own score**, in the page's own rank order rather than re-sorted.

#### Diagnostics

`TOOL_LOG_CHARS = 2000`, up from 120. On a release build there is no debugger, and this log is the only window into what the model was handed. The 120-character cap is why four bugs sat in shipped code unseen.

#### Test suite

**70/70**: gate 14, action gate 6, navigator prompt 9, field naming 16, container selection 9, split rows 6, title and redundancy 6, separator filter 4.

#### Standing note on Play Protect

Every fresh build triggers "Send app for a security check?". The owner's answer has been **Don't send** every time, and that is now handled automatically during install — it is also the option that does not upload his APK to Google.

#### Open

- The navigator's app-drift detection is still **RUNTIME-UNPROVEN**. It needs a task that actually leaves the target app.
- Field naming is proven for `points` on a live page. `price`, `rating`, `reviews`, `sponsored` and `availability` are proven only by unit test — no store page has been read.
- The demo still needs a genuine multi-step task on film.

### Session 16l — a hint that was never sent, and the agent noticing it left the app (2026-08-29, branch `native`)

#### Correction to Session 16i

**16i claims the repeat hint shipped. It did not.** That entry says: "A no-op repeated twice triggers an explicit 'you are repeating yourself' line." The line was computed into a local variable in `buildPrompt` and **never interpolated into the returned prompt**. It compiled. Kotlin reports an unused local as a warning, which scrolls past in a build log. The model has never once seen it.

The navigator budget fix in 16i is still real — `goalSatisfied()` and the plain-language history were both wired in correctly, and those are what produced the measured 15-steps-to-2 improvement. Only the repeat hint was dead.

`buildPrompt` is now `internal` and lives in the companion object so a test can read the prompt directly. **Nine tests do**, two of them asserting the exact thing that was broken: the hint appears when repeating, and does not when not.

The general lesson: a test that asserts on the loop's *behaviour* would not have caught this. Only reading the prompt text does. Anything the engine computes for the model to read needs a test that reads it.

#### The agent notices when it leaves the app (SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN)

A tap can open an ad, a share sheet or the Play Store, and a call can arrive mid-task. The screen genuinely changed, so the step recorded "screen changed" — which reads as progress — and the loop carried on driving whatever app it had landed in, describing it to the model as though it were the target.

Each step now reads the foreground package. When it is not the target, the history line says so by name: `you are now in com.android.vending, NOT com.android.chrome. Use back() unless leaving was intended.`

**Reported, not corrected.** Some goals legitimately leave the app — a link in an email opens the browser — so the engine states the fact and the model decides. This is the same split as everywhere else: the model owns intent, the engine owns structure. After two consecutive steps away it escalates to an explicit note to press back until it returns.

Ultra's own package is exempt. The action-gate card is the task waiting for a tap, not a detour.

This matters for the owner's stated worry about the phone taking a call mid-task: the agent now sees the dialer in the foreground and is told, in words, that it is not where it should be.

#### Sponsored and availability are named (PROVEN offline)

Completing the field naming from 16k for the buying case. The cheapest result is not the best buy if it is an ad, and a price on an out-of-stock item is the classic wrong answer to "find the cheapest". Both facts used to arrive as anonymous lines beside the price.

- `sponsored` is anchored to the **whole label**, not matched as a substring. "ad" inside *Ad*apter and R*ad*io would otherwise mark half a results page as paid placement — the same class of bug as `tor` matching calcula*tor* in 16j, which is now twice.
- `availability` matches in both directions, so "In stock" is as visible as "Currently unavailable".

One existing test asserted "Sponsored" was unrecognised. That expectation is what changed, so the test changed with it.

#### Test suite

**54/54**: gate 14, action gate 6, field naming 16, container selection 9, navigator prompt 9.

Three real bugs in shipped code have now been found by tests written offline: the size-biased container score, the dead repeat hint, and the substring matches. **None of them threw an error.** All three produced a confident wrong answer or a silent no-op, which is the failure mode this app has to be tested for.

#### Open

- Everything in 16k and 16l is device-unproven. No phone has been attached since 16j.
- `restoreScroll`, the drift detection, and the field naming all need one run on a real page.
- The demo still needs a genuine multi-step task on film.

### Session 16k — a read stops moving the page, and a scoring bug the tests caught (2026-08-29, branch `native`)

Owner left mid-session: "fix that and proceed improving the app in the next logical ways."

#### A deep read puts the page back where it found it (SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN)

Reading was moving the screen. `deepRead` scrolled to the bottom and left it there, so the next tool call saw a different page than the one the model had just been told about — it taps the third row and hits whatever scrolled into that spot.

`restoreScroll(scrolls)` scrolls back the same number of times, **not to the top**, because the page was not necessarily at the top when the read began. Best-effort: a failed restore is logged and never fails a read that already succeeded. Restore uses `RESTORE_SETTLE_MS = 250L` against the read's 650, since scrolling back renders nothing worth waiting for.

**No phone was attached.** Compiles and the suite passes; the behaviour has not been seen on a device.

#### Fields carry names now (PROVEN offline, 12 tests)

Session 16d fixed *which price belongs to which product*. It did not fix *which of a row's values is the price* — the row arrived as ordered anonymous lines and the model guessed from position, which is the same inference problem one level down.

`ScreenStructure.fields()` names a field only when the text proves it: `price`, `rating`, `reviews`, `points`, and the leading label as `title`. Anything matching no pattern, **or matching two unrelated ones**, is printed as it appeared with no name. A wrong name is worse than no name, because a named field gets trusted.

Rows showing more than one price list all of them and say `do not assume which is charged`. A list price beside a sale price is the normal case, and quietly picking one is how the agent buys the wrong thing.

Tests cover the ambiguous cases specifically: a rating line that also carries a count, a bare number, "48 out of 5", and two prices in one row.

#### The container scoring was size-biased (FIXED — and it was live)

The new synthetic-tree tests caught a real bug in shipped code.

```
14-entry nav menu, 2 labels each:  14 x 1.0 x 2 = 28   ← won
 5-product grid,   4 labels each:   5 x 1.0 x 4 = 20
```

`score = count x uniformity x substance` measured substance as a **count of labels**. The count term is linear, and two labels versus four does not overcome a 2.8x count advantage.

**The page it was validated against happened to have eleven products**, which scored 44 and hid this. A search page showing five results above the fold would have read the left-hand navigation menu instead — silently, as a confident list of departments.

Substance is now **characters of text in the median row**. A nav entry carries about seven characters; a product row forty-plus. That is the thing that actually differs. `SUBSTANCE_CAP` raised 40 → 300 so one container of long paragraphs cannot outscore a genuine list.

The eleven-product layout is now a regression test in its own right, so a later tweak to the heuristic cannot quietly undo what was proven on hardware.

**Worth keeping:** this is the second time this heuristic has been wrong in a way that produces a confident wrong answer rather than an error, and the first time a test found it instead of a phone.

#### The About tool count reads from the manifest

The literal had rotted twice (24 → 30 → 31). `Manifest.size` and `Manifest.fromAssets()` now exist, `Brain` uses the shared loader, and the About screen states the count the gate actually enforces — or `MANIFEST UNREADABLE - every tool will be refused` if it cannot load, which is the truthful reading of that state.

It currently says 31, which the literal also said. It will not agree by luck next time.

#### Test suite

**41/41**: gate 14, action gate 6, field naming 12, container selection 9. Container and field logic are now provable without a phone, which is what made the scoring bug findable.

#### Open

- `restoreScroll` needs a device. So does the field naming against a real store page.
- The demo still needs a genuine multi-step task on film.
- Structured extraction now names fields; it still does not know a row is *out of stock* or *sponsored*, which matters for "find the best buy".

### Session 16j — R8, and the public repo becomes the proof of creation (2026-08-28/29, branch `native`)

Owner: "turn on R8 and test the build" → "make the public repo my proof of creation… screen shots of the advance task… architecture overview, non revealing… a slide show demo. and a roadmap" → "any screen shots must be clear, show no internal work, each must have a written explanation."

#### R8 (PROVEN on device)

`minifyEnabled` and `shrinkResources` are on for `release`. The APK went **15,014,327 → 8,665,752 bytes**, a 42% cut.

The risk with this app is not Compose or Room, it is **JNI**. Native symbols bind by exact class and method name — `Java_com_agent_ultra_local_LlmNative_nativeLoad` has to still be called that after shrinking, and R8 has no way to know. `proguard-rules.pro` keeps:

- `LlmNative` entirely, plus `TokenCallback.onToken`, which the C++ calls back into.
- The service classes **by name only** (`-keep,allowobfuscation,allowoptimization`), because the manifest and `enabled_accessibility_services` refer to them as strings.
- The Room `data` package, whose generated code reflects over field names.

Verified by installing the minified build and loading Qwen2.5 7B on the phone, not by reading the mapping file. It loaded and answered.

**Honest note the owner made himself:** the unobfuscated APK had already been public for about six hours. R8 protects builds from here; it does not retrieve what shipped.

#### The "looks sensitive" check was flagging Calculator (FIXED)

Found while framing the safety screenshot — one screen away from being published as a feature demonstration.

`looksSensitive()` matched hints as bare substrings, so the hint `tor` matched **calcula*tor*** and **edi*tor***. Calculator and Avatar Editor were being offered as apps to protect.

Short hints (≤4 characters) now have to sit on a token boundary — package names are dotted and lowercase, so splitting on `.`, `_` and `-` gives the tokens. Longer hints keep substring matching, which is safe at that length. `tor` was replaced with `torproject` and `orbot`, and `irs` with `taxact`, since both were guessing at the wrong thing anyway.

The failure was cosmetic, not a safety hole — a false positive over-protects. But it was about to appear in a screenshot arguing the safety model is precise.

#### The advanced task, run for real (PROVEN)

Ran on the A15 with Chrome allowed (`app policy: mode=allowlist allowed=1 protected=5`):

```
open https://news.ycombinator.com and list the top stories with their points
→ STRUCTURED 60 items, 5 scrolls
→ 8 stories, each with its own score
```

The part worth keeping: **two entries genuinely have no score, and it reported "no points listed" rather than borrowing a nearby number.** That is the structured extraction from Session 16d doing its job — pairing comes from the tree, so an absent field reads as absent instead of drifting to the neighbour.

Venice was seeded onto the test phone by writing `ultra_provider.json` into the app's files directory, so the key never appeared on a command line. **The seed file was deleted afterwards.**

#### The release site

`dafarusd.github.io/Ultra-Agent-Release` — one page, GitHub Pages off `main` at `/root`.

- Five screenshots, each with a written explanation: the Hacker News run, the model picker, the safety screen, the on-device engine, the model-fit banding.
- Architecture as **four layers described by responsibility only** — perceive, decide, gate, act and verify. No file names, no algorithms, no thresholds. A reader learns what it does and not how to rebuild it.
- "What it will not do", written as design rather than disclaimer.
- A roadmap, and a provenance section crediting **gatellml** (the policy gate), **gate** (the resolve channel) and **Mind Meld**, each linking to its public repo.

All assets verified serving 200, including the 8,665,752-byte APK.

**Caveat carried on purpose:** the screenshots come from the mid-range A15, which is why larger models read "too big for this phone" at 1,840 MB of headroom. A flagship reads very differently. The page does not claim otherwise, but anyone on good hardware will find those numbers pessimistic.

#### Posted

Site linked as a reply on the announcement (`status/2093413816822305144`) rather than a fresh post — the audience that engaged is already in that thread.

**New composer quirk, logged to `vault/publishing/log.md`:** X warns "Only the first 280 characters will be visible on the timeline", and that fold counts **displayed** characters, not the 23-character t.co length. The approved draft had the URL on the last line, which put it below the fold on a post whose entire purpose was the link. Moved to line two, at character 148. On any long post carrying a link, the link goes inside the first 280 characters.

#### Open

- The demo still needs a genuine multi-step task on film. The Hacker News run is now that task and it exists as stills; nobody has recorded it moving.
- The About screen's tool count has rotted twice (24 → 30 → 31) and should read from the manifest.
- Structured fields are ordered, not labelled — the extractor knows a row has three values, not that the third is a price.
- A deep read leaves the page scrolled where it stopped. Harmless so far, but it means two reads of the same screen do not start from the same place.

### Session 16i — navigator budget fix, release build, announcement (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

#### The navigator stops burning its budget (PROVEN)

The measured failure, carried since Session 14e: "go to google.com in Chrome" loaded the page on step one and then spent the remaining fourteen steps deciding whether it was finished.

- **`goalSatisfied()` checks the screen directly** instead of waiting for the model to declare `done`. When the goal names a destination and the screen shows it, that is the answer — no model turn required. Checked before the loop as well, so a launch that already satisfies the goal costs zero steps.
- **History speaks plainly**: an action is recorded as `NO CHANGE - do not repeat this` or `FAILED - do not repeat this`, and the prompt forbids repeating those. A no-op repeated twice triggers an explicit "you are repeating yourself" line.

```
before:  Error: navigation incomplete after 15 steps: iteration budget exhausted
after:   Goal achieved after 2 steps
repeat:  Goal achieved after 0 steps: already showing the goal
```

#### Two bugs found while filming the demo

1. **"brain fault — the coroutine scope left the composition."** Runs were launched from the chat screen's own composition scope, so opening Settings mid-task cancelled the task and printed an error. Agent work is process-scoped now (`ChatStore.agentScope`, a SupervisorJob), `thinking` moved with it, and `CancellationException` is no longer rendered as a fault.
2. **The 7B was running the fast path.** "What is my battery level" took tens of seconds where the cloud takes about one. A large model is the offline brain, not the quick answer: above 2.5 GB the local route is reserved for being offline and for an explicit `/local`.

#### Release build, and the on-device model on the owner's phone

`release` already shared the debug keystore, so the release APK **installed over the top with settings intact** — verified by re-running the allowlist refusal on it. `debuggable` is gone, so `run-as` no longer works and configuration is UI-only from here.

Qwen2.5 7B (4,466 MB) downloaded through the app's own UI and loaded in **4.46 s**, answering `/local what is the capital of France` with no network.

Two download bugs surfaced doing it: progress never rendered because `onProgress` wrote Compose state from OkHttp's IO thread (the same class of bug as the chat crash), and two downloads could run at once onto the same `model.part`, producing a corrupt file of exactly the right size. Progress hops to the main thread and reports once a second; `downloadModel` is single-flight.

#### Published

- **Source private**: `github.com/dafarusd/Ultra-Agent`, branch `native`. Verified 404 unauthenticated.
- **Public download**: `github.com/dafarusd/Ultra-Agent-Release` — README plus the APK, which pulls 15,014,327 bytes with no login.
- **Announcement posted** to @Dafarusd, opening "A local LLM running on Android. On the phone itself." Every number in it verified against a run from today, per the publishing rule. X moved the account into graduated access while posting.
- A competitor found it within minutes: **@TonyZ278264 ("LocalLLM")**, building an on-device LLM app for iOS, asked how long 4.4 GB stays resident before Android reclaims it. Answered honestly with nothing proprietary — memory-mapped weights, 4.5 s cold load, and that footprint is why the app scores models against the device.
- **Every public repo now links back to @Dafarusd**: `everyvoice`, `gate`, `mindmeld`, `sentinel-public`, `Ultra-Agent-Release`. Standing rule from this session.

#### The video: recorded, not shipped

A 3:34 walkthrough was recorded and cut to 1:47 at 2x. **The owner reviewed it and declined to post it**, for two reasons worth keeping:

1. **The conversation drawer shows the test queries** — "read my last text message", "open youtube" — which read badly out of context even though both were deliberate safety tests.
2. **It does not show a real multi-step task.** The demo proves the app runs; it does not prove the agent *does* anything hard. That is a fair reading and it is a gap in the demo, not only in the film.

He will record his own. Files kept at `~/Videos/agent-ultra-demo-2x.mp4` (1:47) and `agent-ultra-demo-full-3m34.mp4`.

**Harness limitation, now reproducible:** X's composer will not bind a video placed into its file input programmatically. Three attempts, two encodings, 1.7 MB and 5.6 MB, in both a post and a reply. The upload reports "Preparing media…" and completes, then the post publishes without it. **Attaching media to X is hand-only** — same class as the account-switch limitation already logged. Belongs in `vault/publishing/log.md`.


#### Public repo housekeeping (all five, verified live)

Checked every public repo for a description, a real README, and a link back to @Dafarusd. Consistency across channels is the credibility mechanism in `vault/publishing/CLAUDE.md` — a reader who follows a post to the repo should find the same name.

| Repo | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `everyvoice` | no description | description added |
| `gate` | description had a run of stray spaces ("LLM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agents") | cleaned, wording unchanged |
| `mindmeld` | fine | unchanged |
| `sentinel-public` | no description, **no LICENSE at all** | description added, AGPL-3.0 + NOTICE added |
| `Ultra-Agent-Release` | no description | description added |

All five now end their README with `Built by Dafarus — @Dafarusd on X`. Standing rule from this session: every public README links the personal account.

**`sentinel-public` had no license**, which its own README flagged — default copyright applied and nobody could legally reuse it. Now **AGPL-3.0-only** with the same commercial-exception NOTICE `gate` uses, chosen by the owner for consistency with the other three. The README paragraph saying "no license file is included yet" was true until then and would have become a false claim; rewritten to state the actual terms.

Descriptions are repo settings, not files — API-only, and there is no token on this machine. Set through GitHub in the browser, where the owner was already signed in. Worth remembering: **the browser is the fallback for anything that needs the GitHub API.**

The whitespace in `gate`'s description was invisible on the repo page because HTML collapses it. It was real in the stored value, which is what search, the API and repo listings use. Verified against the stored value, not the render.

#### Open

- The demo needs a genuine multi-step task to be worth showing. That is the honest next piece of work, not a filming problem.
- The About screen's tool count has now rotted twice (24 → 30 → 31). It should read from the manifest rather than a literal.

### Session 16h — release build, and models chosen per device (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner: "download the on-device model for this phone. i want a list of optional models that will fit the device its installed on… i wont ship with any installed."

#### Shipping shape, confirmed

Nothing is bundled. The APK is **15.0 MB** because it ships with no weights at all; the app shows which models fit *the phone it is installed on* and downloads on demand. That was already the design — this session made the fit judgement real rather than a note in a description.

`fitFor(model, totalRam)` bands a model by its download size as a fraction of the device's total memory: ≤25% **fits comfortably**, ≤45% **tight — will run, may slow under load**, above that **too big for this phone**, and the download button is disabled. llama.cpp memory-maps the weights so a model does not have to fit in free memory to load, but it does have to stay resident to run at a usable speed, and it shares the phone with everything else.

Every size below is the real content-length from the server, not a model card's claim. On the owner's S24 Ultra (11,084 MB):

| Model | Size | Verdict on this phone |
|---|---|---|
| Gemma 3 1B Q4_K_M | 768 MB | fits comfortably |
| Llama 3.2 1B Q4_K_M | 770 MB | fits comfortably |
| Qwen2.5 1.5B Q4_K_M | 940 MB | fits comfortably |
| Gemma 3 1B Q8_0 | 1019 MB | fits comfortably |
| Qwen2.5 3B Q4_K_M | 1840 MB | fits comfortably |
| Phi-3.5 mini 3.8B Q4_K_M | 2282 MB | fits comfortably |
| **Qwen2.5 7B Q4_K_M** | 4466 MB | tight — installed here |
| Llama 3.1 8B Q4_K_M | 4692 MB | tight |
| Gemma 2 9B Q4_K_M | 5494 MB | too big |
| Qwen2.5 14B Q4_K_M | 8571 MB | too big |

On the 3.5 GB A15 the same table reads very differently — everything from 3B up is tight or refused. That is the point of computing it per device.

#### Release build on the owner's phone

`release` was already wired to the same keystore as `debug`, so the release APK **installs over the top with app data intact** — allowed apps, provider key, conversations and recipes all survived, verified by re-running the YouTube refusal on the release build. The one real consequence: `debuggable` is gone, so `run-as` no longer works and configuration is UI-only from here.

Qwen2.5 7B downloaded (4466 MB), loaded in **4.46 s**, and answered `/local what is the capital of France` correctly, entirely on-device. Generation speed was not measured.

#### Two bugs the download exposed

1. **Progress never appeared.** `onProgress` wrote Compose state directly from OkHttp's IO thread — the same class of bug that was crashing the chat screen two sessions ago. Progress now hops to the main thread and reports at most once a second instead of every 256 KB, which on a 4.5 GB file was roughly 17,000 UI writes.
2. **Two downloads could run at once**, both writing the same `model.part` — a corrupt file that still ends up the right size. Caught while it was actually happening, after a chooser tap and a Download tap both fired. `downloadModel` is now single-flight and refuses the second caller.

### Session 16g — allowlist by default, and installing on the owner's own phone (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner: "phone is connected. this is my phone, be careful" — a Galaxy S24 Ultra (SM-S928B), Android 16, 11.3 GB RAM, 204 third-party apps — followed by "this phone may receive a call, text, email… dont mess with them".

#### The blocklist was the wrong shape, and the owner's phone proved it

The seeding rule built on the test device caught 20 apps here. Reading all 204 by hand found **at least 40 more that mattered** and would have been silently reachable: [personal app list removed].

**A block list has to name every risk in advance. On a real phone that is a bet you lose once.** So the default is inverted: `allowlist_mode` is now on from first launch, and the agent may read or act only in apps the owner has ticked. `agentMayUse(pkg)` is the single question every read and every action asks, and it **fails closed** — an unreadable package name is a no.

The hint list was rewritten from what the real phone actually contains rather than from imagination; seeding now catches **71 apps** here, and it no longer has to be complete, because it is only a convenience for the block-list mode.

#### The hole the allowlist does not cover

`sms_read`, `sms_send`, `contacts_read` and `device_location` reach Android's own content providers. **They never go near a screen, so the accessibility policy does not gate them at all.** On a phone taking real calls and texts that is the sharpest edge in the app.

New `PERSONAL DATA` switch, off by default, checked ahead of dispatch. With it off the agent is told plainly that messages, contacts and location are unavailable and to carry on with the rest of the task.

#### A bug that would have broken the owner's phone

`enabled_accessibility_services` is a colon-separated list, and this phone already runs CCleaner's accessibility service. `install.sh` did `settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services $SVC` — **overwriting it**, silently switching off a tool the owner relies on. It now appends, checks for its own entry first, and reports what was there before.

#### State after install — deliberately inert

- Installed, `2.0.0-native`. Launched once so the policy is written.
- `allowlist_mode = true`, **allowed set empty** — the agent can reach nothing.
- Ultra's accessibility service **not enabled**; CCleaner's untouched.
- No dangerous runtime permissions granted: no SMS, contacts, microphone, location, camera, phone or storage. Only install-time normals (network, wifi, bluetooth, foreground service).
- Notification listener not enabled; notification capture off by default.

Nothing runs until the owner chooses which apps the agent may enter.

#### Live on the owner's S24 Ultra — four tests, all read-only

Provider set to Venice (key written through a pushed file, never a command line). Accessibility appended alongside CCleaner's service, allowed list = Chrome, Maps, Calculator.

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| "what is my battery level" | **74%** — cloud loop working on the flagship |
| "open youtube" (not on the list) | **Refused**, not launched. `'YouTube' is not on the user's allowed-apps list` |
| "read my last text message" | **Refused** before touching the SMS provider. No message content read |
| "open news.ycombinator.com and list the top stories with their points" | **60 structured items across 5 screens**, 8 stories returned with title, domain and points correctly paired — and the YC hiring post reported as "no points listed", which is correct, job posts have none |

One more gap closed on the way: `app_launch` uses an Intent, not the accessibility service, so the app policy had to be asked in `launchApp` too. Without it "only apps I choose" would still have put a bank on screen — unreadable, but open.

Harness note: force-stopping the app drops its accessibility service, so any force-stop during setup has to be followed by re-appending. The on-device model is not downloaded on this phone; with 11.3 GB of RAM it could carry a considerably larger one than the A15's Gemma 1B.

### Session 16f — the per-action gate (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner directive: "build the per-action gate. then i connect my phone."

The policy gate checked that `react_navigate`'s *goal* traced to the request and had nothing to say about the taps that followed. Approving "book me a table" approved every tap inside the app, including one labelled "Confirm and pay". This closes that.

#### The rule

A tap stops and asks **only when its target label reads like a commitment**. Reading, scrolling, going back and tapping ordinary controls run untouched. That restraint is the design, not laziness: a gate that interrupts constantly gets approved reflexively, which is worse than no gate.

Matching is positional rather than substring — a button is imperative ("Place your order", "Send", "Buy now") where a navigation item that shares the word is not ("Your Orders", "Order history"). **Both tap paths are covered**, indexed *and* raw-coordinate: a coordinate tap resolves what is nearest first, otherwise the gate is bypassed by the model choosing coordinates over an index.

Two words were deliberately dropped after they failed their own tests: **"sign"** ("Sign in") and **"apply"** ("Apply filters"). Cookie-consent phrasings are excluded for the same reason — consent to tracking is a real decision, but not the class this gate protects, and its frequency would train the operator to tap through without reading. Those are knowing gaps, written down rather than hidden.

**Unit tests: 6/6, 20 overall with the policy gate.** The cases are the specification — money buttons, outbound and destructive actions, navigation that merely shares a word, ordinary controls, punctuation and casing, and a paragraph of prose that mentions "send" without being a button.

#### The hole found by testing it

First live run: the gate fired and withheld the tap correctly — and **the confirmation card was invisible**. The navigator drives another app, so Ultra is in the background when the question appears. A card nobody can see is a gate that silently denies everything after its two-minute timeout: safe, and useless.

Fixed both directions. The gate now brings Ultra to the front to ask, and on approval the navigator **puts the target app back before tapping** — otherwise the tap would land on Ultra's own UI at the target's coordinates.

#### Proven on device, against a page built for the purpose

A local page served over `adb reverse` with a dead "Send" button — nothing real could fire.

```
UltraActionGate: PAUSED:   tap_index(3) on "Send" in com.android.chrome (matched "send")
UltraActionGate: RESOLVED: denied — "Send"
UltraNav: action refused by operator: "Send"

UltraActionGate: PAUSED:   tap_index(3) on "Send" in com.android.chrome (matched "send")
UltraActionGate: RESOLVED: approved — "Send"
```

The card names the exact label, the app, and the word that matched, and says plainly that ignoring it cancels the action. An unanswered prompt is a denial, never an approval.

#### Open

- **Approval is per-tap, not per-run.** When the navigator retries a step that produced no visible change, it asks again. Safe, and repetitive.
- The task-memory success rule counts "model produced a final answer with no tool failures" as success. A model that gives up gracefully looks identical to one that succeeded — observed live: a run that never pressed the button was recorded as `app_launch → web_search`. Needs a real completion check, not an absence-of-errors check.
- Typing is not gated; the commitment is the button that follows it. `typeInto` auto-fires IME_ENTER, so a form that submits on Enter is a gap.

### Session 16e — protected apps: the safety net that had no rope in it (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner question: "is it safe to test on my real phone as it has apps connected to real accounts?"

Answering it properly meant reading the enforcement rather than trusting the design. Four findings, three of them gaps.

#### What the audit found

1. **The blocklist existed and was never populated.** `AgentAccessibilityService` had `blockPackage`, `isPackageBlocked`, `getBlockedPackages` and a `blockedPackages` set. Nothing anywhere called `blockPackage`. It was an in-memory static that was empty for the life of the process — a safety net with no rope in it.
2. **Blocking only covered acting, not looking.** `isPackageBlocked` was consulted in exactly one place: `checkPackageAllowed`, which gates taps, typing, scrolling. `getScreenContentFlat` and `getScreenTree` never checked it. Worse the wrong way round, because **whatever the agent reads is sent to the cloud model as a tool result** — so "don't act in my bank" would still have shipped the bank's screen to Venice.
3. **The notification listener was standing collection.** `UltraNotificationService` appended every notification's title and 120 characters of body to `files/notifications.log` continuously, whether or not a task was running — message previews and one-time codes included. 88 lines were already on the device. App-private, but collected by default and never asked for.
4. **The navigator does not gate individual actions.** The gate checks that `react_navigate`'s *goal* traces to the request. Once inside, `ReActNavigator` calls `controller.tap/typeInto/scroll` directly — no `enforceCall` anywhere in that file. Approving "book me a table" approves every tap that follows it. This one is **not fixed** and is the largest remaining risk.

#### What was built

- **A real protected-apps list.** Persisted in SharedPreferences, loaded at `onServiceConnected` and again whenever Settings changes it.
- **Enforced on reads as well as actions.** `getScreenContentFlat` and `getScreenTree` return the sentinel `PROTECTED` when a protected app is in front, and the read tools turn that into a message naming the reason. Previously a blocked read would have surfaced as "screen empty or accessibility service not running", which is both unhelpful and untrue.
- **Settings UI**: every launchable app, searchable, protected ones first, with the package name shown and a `· looks sensitive` marker on guesses.
- **First-run seeding.** Package-name fragments (bank names, wallet, pay, authenticator, password managers, health, tax) pre-tick likely-sensitive apps at app start, before the agent has had a chance to read anything. On this device it caught Samsung Wallet and Samsung Health. It is a visible guess the user can change, never a silent decision.
- **Notification capture is now off by default**, skips protected apps entirely, and the log can be deleted from Settings.

#### Proven on device

- Seeding wrote `com.samsung.android.spay` and `com.sec.android.app.shealth`; service logged `protected apps loaded: 2`.
- Chrome protected through the UI → `protected apps loaded: 3` → asked the agent to read a page in Chrome: every read refused at the native layer (`SCREEN_FLAT: BLOCKED — protected app in front`), and the agent told the user *"The Chrome browser is on your protected list, and I'm not allowed to read its screen."*
- Chrome unprotected again → reading works normally. Gate unit tests 14/14.

#### Still open, and it matters

`react_navigate` taps are ungated once the goal is approved. Protecting an app keeps the navigator out of it entirely — that is the mitigation today — but within an *unprotected* app the agent can tap anything the model decides to tap. A per-action check inside the navigator (at minimum: a confirm before any control whose label reads like send, pay, buy, confirm, delete, or transfer) is the next piece of safety work.

### Session 16d — structured extraction: which price belongs to which product (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner directive: "do the structured extraction."

Deep reading had solved *how much* the agent could see. It had not solved *what belongs with what* — the output was a flat label list, and the pairing of a price to a product was the model's inference. Inference is where a confident wrong answer comes from.

#### The first attempt failed, and the failure was informative

Grouping by the parent links in `getScreenContentFlat` produced items whose prices were paired correctly with their own deal context but had **no product names**:

> 1. Unknown product - $34.99 (Limited time deal, Typical: $159.99)

Cause, found by dumping the live Amazon tree: `getScreenContentFlat` only emits **labelled or interactive** nodes and links each child to its nearest *emitted* ancestor. Amazon's mobile page is built from unlabelled wrapper `View`s, so the entire card hierarchy collapsed into one flat fan-out. The item boundaries were destroyed before any grouping code could see them.

#### `getScreenTree()` — a second native read that keeps the structure

Every node with real bounds, containers included, capped at 3000 nodes and depth 60. **Deliberately separate from `getScreenContentFlat`**: the navigator taps by index into that list, and adding containers would shift every index out from under it.

#### Container selection: uniformity, not size

Three scorings were tried against a dumped live Amazon page before writing any Kotlin — offline iteration, no rebuild cycle:

| Scoring | What it picked |
|---|---|
| most item-shaped children | the page banner (125 flat children) |
| children × median height | the sign-in row — **virtualised list rows report zero bounds**, so area is meaningless here |
| children × uniformity × substance | **the product grid** |

The winning signal is that a real list's children all carry a *similar amount* of content — the Amazon grid's children had identical label counts. Multiplying by median labels per item breaks the tie against a fourteen-entry navigation menu of two words each, which is perfectly uniform and carries nothing.

When no container scores, the read falls back to flat with a line saying so. Inventing groups where there are none is exactly the failure being fixed.

Also filtered: `ref=…` tracking parameters and opaque ids, which are labels to a screen reader and noise to a reader. Repeated titles (pages emit them once per image link, heading and anchor) are collapsed.

#### Result — same request, same page

Before deep reading: *"the price of the first result is not available."*
After deep reading, flat: prices with no idea which product they belonged to.
After structured extraction:

> 1. Apple AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds - $199.99 (List: $249.00)
> 2. Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones - $19.98 (Typical price: $249.99)
> 3. Active Noise Cancelling Ear Buds 48H Wireless Earbuds - $34.99 (Typical: $159.99)
> 4. Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds - **No price listed**

Item 4 is the part worth noticing: it reported a missing price instead of borrowing the one above it. The pairing comes from the tree now, not from the model's guess.

This is not a shopping feature. The same shape — a container of uniform, multi-field children — is an inbox, a chat thread, a feed, a file list, a settings page.

#### Regression

Gate unit tests 14/14. Device suite 9/9; t08 still detours through a `react_navigate` that exhausts its 15-step budget and recovers via `open_url` — the known navigator issue, unchanged. Flashlight off at the end.

#### Open

- The navigator's step efficiency, still.
- Deep reads leave the page where they finished scrolling.
- Item fields are ordered, not named. `price` is tagged when exactly one price appears in a row; title, rating and delivery are not distinguished from each other.
- Container selection is validated against one real page shape. It falls back safely, but a second and third page type deserve the same offline check.

### Session 16c — deep perception, and memory that learns the right lesson (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner directives: "fix the perception depth, remove the 40 node cap and add scrolling. i need deep perception." and "when it performs a task correctly it needs to remember."

#### Deep perception (PROVEN — the task that failed yesterday now works)

The measured failure: asked for Amazon prices, the agent reached the right page and then reported *"the price of the first result is not available."* Cause was one line in `Tools.summarizeFlat` — `if (lines.size >= 40) break`. Forty labels off the top of a commerce page is the app-install banner and the sign-in prompt. It had the page and could not see it.

What changed:

- **The 40-label cap is gone.** Perception is bounded by a character budget now (4000 for a viewport read, 12000 for a deep read), because a node count punishes a page for having short labels. Labels keep 120 chars instead of 80. When the budget truncates, the output says so and names the tool that reads further.
- **New tool `read_screen_deep {maxScrolls?}`** — scrolls the page and accumulates labels in order, dropping duplicates across overlapping reads, stopping as soon as a scroll yields nothing new. Default 12 scrolls, ceiling 30. Declared in the gate manifest as a read.
- **`performScrollDeep` in the accessibility service.** The existing `performScroll` had two faults for this job: it used `getRootInActiveWindow()`, which is the keyboard or an overlay as often as the app, and it scrolled the *first* scrollable it found — usually a narrow carousel, not the list you want. The new one scans windows the way `getScreenContentFlat` does and scrolls the **largest** scrollable by screen area.
- **Native child cap raised 60 → 200.** Result lists and feeds routinely exceed 60 children, so the tree walk was truncating before the label budget ever applied.

Same request, same page, after the change:

```
UltraPerceive: deep scroll 1: +14 new (total 60)
...
UltraPerceive: deep read: 126 labels, 10 scrolls, 4463 chars
```

> The prices of the first few results for wireless earbuds on Amazon are:
> - $25.99 for TAGRY Bluetooth Headphones True Wireless Earbuds
> - $18.99 for Top Reviewed for Battery life earbuds (exclusive Prime price)
> - $26.55 for TOZO NC9 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds

126 items across 11 screens, against 40 labels of page header before. It was still gaining content at scroll 10, which is why the default is 12 rather than 8.

#### Task memory rewritten — it was learning the wrong things

Inspecting the table showed three separate defects, all visible in the data:

1. **Exact-string keys split the same job.** `whats my location` and `what is my location` were two rows with two memories. So were `what is the battery level` and `what is my battery level`. In real use — especially spoken — a memory keyed on exact wording almost never hits.
2. **It recorded failures as successes.** Success was counted per tool call. The Amazon run that ended *"the price is not available"* was stored as the way to do that job, because `web_search → web_search → open_url → read_text_on_screen` each returned without an error. The wrong lesson, ready to be replayed.
3. **The reliability warning was pure noise.** `react_navigate 0/4` was injected into every single request this session, relevant or not, including "what is my battery level".

What it does now:

- **Matching is a token-set score over content words**, using containment rather than Jaccard — the same job asked at different lengths scored badly under Jaccard purely for being wordier. Generic request verbs (`open`, `launch`, `tell`, `show`, `find`, `check`…) are stopwords, because "open chrome" and "open amazon" are different jobs and shouldn't look half the same. Threshold 0.5.
- **A task is recorded only when the task succeeded**: the model finished with its own answer and nothing failed on the way. Running out of turns, giving up after a repeated failure, and ending on a gate block are all not successes. Per-tool reliability is still counted per call — that genuinely is a per-call fact.
- **Full calls with arguments are stored** (`stepsJson`, DB v4 with a real 3→4 migration), so a hint can name the approach rather than just the tool.
- **The AVOID warning is scoped**: a tool is only named when it has 3+ failures *and* was not part of the approach that worked for this kind of request.
- **The on-device route consults memory too.** It previously ignored it entirely — only the cloud loop got hints. A single-tool recall is injected as one short line, which is what a 1B model can follow.

Proven on device:

- Taught `what is my battery level` → recorded. Asked `hows the battery doing` in a fresh chat → `MEMORY HINT (local): battery_status`, correct tool, no cloud call. Under the old rule this created a second, unrelated row.
- Taught `turn on the flashlight`, then asked `open chrome` → no false recall.
- `open the Spotify app and play my liked songs` (not installed, two tool failures) → **no memory recorded**.

Shortcuts written under the old rule were cleared, since every one of them was recorded by the broken success test. Conversations, recipes, and reliability counters were kept.

#### Regression

Gate unit tests 14/14. Device suite 9/9 — and `read_screen_deep` was chosen unprompted on the Wikipedia task, which is the prompt guidance landing.

#### Open

- `read_screen_deep` reads labels, not structure. It got prices because the prices are labels on that page. It has no notion of "this price belongs to that product" — a real extraction pass is still missing.
- Deep reads leave the page scrolled where they finished; nothing scrolls back.
- Navigator step efficiency, still untouched.

### Session 16b — model chooser, and answers to three owner questions (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

#### Speak-back is ear-verified

Owner: "i heard it, it works." The hands-free chain is now proven end to end by a human, not only by `SPEAK START` in logcat. That was the last open item on M7.1.

#### Assistant role — confirmed selectable, and proven

Ultra does not implement a `VoiceInteractionService`, so it registers as a legacy assist app. It **is** listed in Samsung's Digital assistant picker, but under a collapsed **"Other apps"** heading — not in the top-level list, which is why it looks absent. Selected it and proved the path:

- `secure assistant` → `com.agent.ultra/.VoiceActivity`
- `KEYCODE_ASSIST` from the home screen → VoiceActivity focused, `UltraVoice: LISTENING`
- `KEYCODE_ASSIST` from a dozing screen → phone woke, VoiceActivity focused, listening. `setShowWhenLocked` + `setTurnScreenOn` doing their job.
- Backgrounded mid-task (Home pressed right after `HEARD`): launcher took focus, the tool still ran and the answer was still spoken.

Not verified: behaviour over a **secure** lock screen. This phone has no PIN set (`lockscreen.password_type` is null), so the keyguard never challenged. `setShowWhenLocked` is the right API for it, but that is a claim, not a measurement.

#### On-device model is now switchable (was hardcoded)

Before this, `MODEL_URL` and the filename were constants — the only way to change the model was `adb push`. Now:

- `LocalModelEngine` keeps the URL, filename, and label in SharedPreferences. `selectModel()` unloads the current weights first: the native context holds an mmap of the old file and two sets do not fit on a 3.5GB phone.
- Each model lands under its own filename, so switching does not clobber a model already downloaded and switching back costs nothing.
- Five presets, **every URL checked to resolve with its real content-length**, not the model card's claim: Gemma 3 1B Q4_K_M (768 MB, the tuned default), Llama 3.2 1B Q4_K_M (770 MB), Gemma 3 1B Q8_0 (1019 MB), Qwen2.5 1.5B Q4_K_M (940 MB), Qwen2.5 3B Q4_K_M (1840 MB, flagged as likely not to fit).
- A custom GGUF URL field for anything else, with the honest caveat about size and format.

#### "Present but not loaded" was two things

One was correct behaviour reported badly, one was a bug.

- Correct: weights sit on disk and map into memory lazily on first use (~3s), then stay until the process ends. The text now reads "Downloaded (768 MB) — loads on first use" and explains itself, rather than the alarming "not loaded".
- Bug: the status was computed once in a `remember` and never refreshed, so it said "not loaded" even after the model had loaded. It now polls while the screen is open. Verified: ran a local command, returned to Settings, and it read "In memory and ready (768 MB)".

#### Why the header said "a11y off"

The chip was telling the truth — `enabled_accessibility_services` was `null` and `accessibility_enabled` was `0`. **Android disables an accessibility service whenever its app is force-stopped**, and this session's voice testing force-stopped the app repeatedly without re-enabling it. Nothing to fix in the indicator; the chip is now red and tappable, going straight to the settings screen that fixes it. The standing operational hazard is unchanged and worth remembering: any force-stop — the owner's, or Samsung's battery management — silently disables the agent's eyes and hands.

### Session 16 — M7.1 the ear, M7.2 recipes, Venice provider (2026-08-28, branch `native`)

Owner directive: "go with 1 and 2, the ear and recipes… use my venice api instead of openrouter… complete polish… an AI agent like no other."

#### Provider moved to Venice (PROVEN)

Key found at `~/.config/opencode/.env` (`VENICE_API_KEY`), base URL `https://api.venice.ai/api/v1`. Benchmarked four Venice models against the app's real system prompt: **`llama-3.3-70b` picked 5/5 tools correctly at a 1.44s median** — the others missed the battery case by answering in prose. Same model family Build 29 proved, now on his own account. Written to the phone's SharedPreferences through a pushed file so the key never entered a command line.

**The trap, measured:** Venice prepends its own ~1000-token system prompt by default. On `llama-3.3-70b` that takes prompt_tokens from 26 to 1081 and **breaks the chat template outright** — replies come back as `assistant<|end_header_id|>assistant\assistant…`, or the model answers questions about itself instead of the user's. On device it produced "You are currently running as the Llama 3.3 70B model." as the final answer to every task, while the tools underneath ran correctly. `OpenAiClient` now sends `venice_parameters.include_venice_system_prompt = false`, for venice.ai hosts only.

#### M7.1 — the ear (PROVEN end to end, acoustically)

- `VoiceActivity` registered for `ACTION_ASSIST` / `VOICE_COMMAND`, shows over the lock screen, opens the mic on entry. `onNewIntent` restarts listening — `singleTask` means a repeat assist gesture never reaches `onCreate`, so without it the mic opened exactly once per process.
- `Speaker`: on-device `TextToSpeech`, queue/start/done logged under `UltraSpeak` so speak-back is verifiable from a machine that cannot hear the phone. Speech text is stripped of emoji, code fences, raw tool JSON, and URLs are read as domains.
- `VoiceInput` gained state and error callbacks, prefers the offline recognizer, and names every recognizer error code.
- Hands-free is reachable from the quick-action row (🎧) before the user has made Ultra their assistant app; Settings has a "Choose assistant app" shortcut and a speak-answers toggle for typed use.

**The acoustic test (the plan from the opencode session, carried out):** laptop speaks through its own speaker, phone listens through the air, no human involved.

```
UltraVoice: LISTENING
UltraVoice: HEARD: "What is the battery level"
UltraBrain: LOCAL turn 0: {"tool":"battery_status","params":{}}
UltraBrain: RUN COMPLETE (local, tool=battery_status, ok=true)
UltraSpeak: SPEAK QUEUE (36 chars) → SPEAK START
```

Spoken words → on-device transcription → tool call → real device state → spoken answer. Reproduced twice. The error path was proven too: a phrase it could not catch spoke "I didn't catch that" and logged the full QUEUE → START → DONE lifecycle.

**Honest limits.** Recognition of a *synthetic* voice over air is phrase-dependent — "what is the battery level" transcribed reliably, "what is the capital of Japan" returned `ERROR_NO_MATCH` twice. That is a property of a text-to-speech voice played into a microphone, not of the app. **NOT ear-verified:** nobody has heard the phone speak; `SPEAK START`/`SPEAK DONE` is engine-level proof. Both need one sentence from a human voice and one listen.

#### M7.2 — recipes (PROVEN on device)

A recipe is the user promoting a successful run into something they can name and re-run. `RecipeEntity` + `RecipeDao`, DB v3 with a **real 2→3 migration** — conversations and task memory are user data now, not dev scratch, so the destructive fallback is no longer the migration path.

Proven sequence, each step in a fresh conversation:

1. "tell me my battery level and then read my notifications" → `battery_status` → `notification_read`
2. "save that as morning briefing" → `Saved recipe "morning briefing": battery_status → notification_read`
3. "run my morning briefing" (new chat) → `RECIPE RUN morning briefing (2 steps)` → both steps executed, gate allowed both

**Gate semantics for replay.** On replay the stored arguments no longer appear in the user's words — "run morning briefing" contains no URL — so every traceability contract would block. The steps were user-attested when the recipe was named, so replay mints them as confirmed targets for that episode via the existing `Episode.confirm`. Taint, spoof, and undeclared-tool checks are untouched and still apply. All four recipe tools are declared in the manifest (deny-by-default means an undeclared tool cannot run at all).

**Matching a recipe name is deterministic, not model-judged.** Measured: llama-3.3-70b read "run my morning briefing" as a question and answered "You are currently running as the Llama 3.3 70B model." A recipe name is a string the user chose; resolving it is a lookup. The engine now owns that, the same split as the local router.

#### Bugs found and fixed while testing

1. **Process crash — Compose state written off the main thread.** `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Reading a state that was created after the snapshot was taken`, thrown in the global snapshot observer, killing the app mid-run. Cause: streaming callbacks wrote `ChatStore.messages` from OkHttp's IO threads and the on-device model's worker. Every mutation now funnels through a main-thread hop, and streamed bubbles are addressed **by id, not index** — indices shift when anything else is added or removed mid-stream.
2. **Local-route runs never fed task memory**, so "save that as X" after an on-device command had nothing to save.
3. **Dead code in `runLocalLoop`** — a prompt built and immediately overwritten. Removed.
4. **1B chatter** — the model replayed its own few-shot examples after its answer. Output is now cut at the first echoed turn; logs are clean.
5. **`install.sh` missed dialogs** — it matched one button label with a straight apostrophe. It now matches every variant (Samsung uses a curly one), polls the whole install window, and **fails loudly if `lastUpdateTime` did not change** rather than letting a test run against stale code.
6. **Two model loads** — `LocalModelEngine` is process-wide now, so the voice session shares the one 800MB context instead of loading its own.
7. The a11y chip in the header is red and tappable when the service is off — one tap to the settings screen that fixes it.

#### Regression

- Gate unit tests: **14/14**, unchanged.
- Device suite: **8/8**, every task selecting the right tool. Dedupe confirmed working (repeat calls log `TOOL CALL` with no `TOOL RESULT`).
- `suite.sh` now turns the flashlight **off** after t07 — the suite used to walk away with the torch burning.

#### Open

- Navigator step efficiency is still model-tuned, not fixed. Untouched this session.
- Wake word deliberately not built: always-on audio costs battery, adds Play-policy risk, and needs a bundled wake engine. The assist gesture is the shipped path and needs no always-on mic.
- t05's third `clipboard_write` was not deduped because a different tool ran in between. Correct per the rule, still wasteful.
- Recognition quality for a real human voice, and whether the phone is actually audible, are both unverified.

### Session 15b — voice, streaming, search quality, task memory, final regression 8/8 (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

#### Shipped this session (all device-verified unless stated)

- **Voice input** (`ui/VoiceInput.kt`): mic button on the input row; on-device SpeechRecognizer (SODA) fills the box for review before Send. PROVEN: session start confirmed in logcat; transcription NOT automatable over adb — untested, honestly.
- **SSE streaming** (`OpenAiClient.completeStreaming`): cloud answers stream live into a chat bubble; tool-call turns retract the bubble; final answers persist from the stream. Plus: a run where every turn blocks now closes with an honest message instead of silence (observed via the improvised `calculate` tool the gate denied).
- **web_search backends**: DDG instant-answer JSON → Wikipedia opensearch+summary → HTML scrape last resort. Fixed the boilerplate-only results from this network environment. PROVEN: "capital of Japan" → "The capital of Japan is Tokyo."
- **Task memory** (`data/TaskMemory.kt`, DB v2): successful tool sequences per normalized request + per-tool reliability counters; hints injected as a system message on repeat requests. PROVEN: run 2 logged "MEMORY HINT injected … previously succeeded with: web_search". This is the P6 idea from Build 29 — it never triggered there; it triggers now.
- **Few-shot local prompt**: measured 1B failure mode was zero-shot picking the wrong tool; with examples it maps correctly, including full JSON (`flashlight_toggle {"on":true}` first-try on t07).
- **Classifier hardening**: compounds (" and / then") and URL-like targets route cloud — suite t03/t05/t08 misses before this fix, passes after.

#### Final regression — 8/8 PASS on the advanced build

t01 battery (on-device) · t02 open chrome · t03 open wikipedia.org (VERIFIED browser) · t04 search (real content) · t05 clipboard write→read round trip · t06 note on disk · t07 flashlight (on-device, first-try JSON) · t08 open chrome + google.com (VERIFIED twice, screen read "ALL").

#### Known gaps after this session

- The gate pauses for confirmation cards mid-suite runs when prior-task content contaminates a later request (by design — the operator resolves). 
- The 1B model echoes prompt examples as chatter before its real answer; the parser holds, but it's ugly in logs.
- Navigator step efficiency is still model-tuned, not fixed.
- Flashlight physical photons remain API-level proof only (no torch-state dump on this Samsung).

### Session 15 — M6 shell parity + capability advances (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

Owner directive mid-session: "make this the leading and most capable AI agent." M6 ordering and genome exclusion confirmed by owner.

#### Shell parity (M6.1, M6.2 — both PROVEN on device)

- **Settings screen** (`ui/SettingsScreen.kt`): provider editor (base URL/API key/model) — kills the adb-seeded `ultra_provider.json` dev backdoor; on-device model panel (status, 806MB download with progress bar, unload); About with version + gate + a11y status. Provider save bumps a `configVersion` key that rebuilds the Brain with the new config. Verified: save → back → tool loop answers from real device state.
- **Conversations** (`data/` Room layer + `ui/ChatStore.kt` rework): conversations + messages tables; drawer (☰) with auto-titled list, new-chat, delete; persistence survives force-stop (verified: relaunch restored the full conversation). Header shows the current conversation title.

#### Capability advances (the "leading agent" work)

1. **Gate resolve/confirm channel — gatellml SPEC §2 R4 made live.** The paper's untested gap ("no interactive channel") is closed: traceability-class blocks pause the run and render a confirm/cancel card in chat with the target shown; the operator's tap mints the target user-attested for the episode (`effectiveRequestNorm`); the loop resumes and executes. Taint/spoof/undeclared are never confirmable. Tests 14/14; live on device: "open the wikipedia site" → gate blocked the paraphrase → Confirm → opened wikipedia.org.
2. **Duplicate-call dedupe** — same tool+params immediately after a success gets "already done" feedback instead of re-firing (killed the double-open_url pattern).
3. **Deterministic post-action verification** — app_launch/open_url verify the foreground app via a NEW live-window scan (`getForegroundPackage()`), clipboard_write reads back. Exposed that the event-sourced package tracker goes stale on rebind; live windows are now ground truth. PROVEN: "open chrome" → VERIFIED: com.android.chrome in front.
4. **Local-first router** — the on-device 1B model handles simple device commands (toggles, alarms, notes, launches, clipboard, battery) with zero cloud calls; complex work escalates automatically. Measured model trait: Gemma 3 1B emits tool NAMES, not JSON — so a deterministic engine (`parseBareToolCall`) shapes params from the request (the mindmeld split: model owns intent, engine owns structure). PROVEN: "turn off the flashlight" → bare name → {"on":false} → gate → executed, fully on-device.

#### Open (named, queued)

- Quick-action row + model chip (M6.3), screenshot/camera/notification tools (M6.4).
- Cloud-loop streaming (SSE) for live token feedback.
- web_search extraction quality (DDG boilerplate in this network environment).
- Navigator step-efficiency tuning.
- Voice input.

### Session 14e — M5: proof suite + two structural fixes it exposed (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

#### The suite (tools/suite.sh — sends tasks, waits for the brain's RUN COMPLETE marker, captures logcat + screenshot per task)

| Task | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| t01 "what is my battery level" | **PASS** | `battery_status` → real 100% charging |
| t02 "open chrome" | **PASS + live gate win** | Chrome launched; model's unprompted `open_url www.google.com` (not in request) **BLOCKED by the gate** |
| t03 "open wikipedia.org" | **PASS** (rerun) | opened; gate allowed (www-normalized) |
| t04 "search the web for the capital of Japan" | **PARTIAL** | tool executed; DDG served page boilerplate in this environment — extraction returned chrome, not answers. Tool-quality issue, not loop issue |
| t05 clipboard round-trip | **PASS** | write "hello world" → read back "hello world" |
| t06 "create a note saying buy milk tomorrow" | **PASS** | note-*.txt on disk in app storage |
| t07 "turn on the flashlight" | **PARTIAL** | CameraManager API returned success ×2; physical light unverified (no torch-state dump on this Samsung) — API-level proof only |
| t08 "open chrome and go to google.com" | **PASS via recovery** | see below |

#### Structural fixes the suite exposed (both proven after the fix)

1. **Text entry into unfocused fields (the old IME-class bug, native root cause).** Navigator symptom: `TEXT: result=false` ×9 with healthy perception. Two-part fix:
   - `ReActNavigator.focusFirstEditable()` — bare `type("…")` now taps the first editable node before typing (nothing can receive text without focus).
   - `AgentAccessibilityService.performText` gained the **multi-window scan** `performImeAction` already had: once the keyboard opens, `getRootInActiveWindow()` is the IME window, not the target app. After: `TEXT: result=true` in Chrome's omnibox + `IME_ENTER result=true`.
2. **Perception dropouts when the app backgrounds** (t03 first run: "accessibility service not running" mid-task). Fixes: `AgentController.serviceOrWait()` polls 3s across bind races; `UltraApplication` now starts `AgentBackgroundService` (ported foreground service, sticky) at app create to resist Samsung's background kill on this 3.5GB device.

#### Unplanned live gate evidence

t08 rerun: model saw "open wikipedia.org" in visible chat history from t03 and tried to open it mid-task → **gate BLOCKED `open_url www.wikipedia.org`** ("does not trace to the user's request"). Cross-task contamination stopped deterministically — the exact attack-adjacent behavior the research gate was built for.

#### Environment honesty notes

- Phone DNS flaked for ~10 min after my airplane/wifi toggles (example.com NXDOMAIN while google.com resolved) — environmental, not the app; t08's first evidence was poisoned by it and re-run clean.
- The model repeats successful calls (opened the same URL twice) and over-searches on weak results — known Build 29 traits carried by the shared prompt; tuning is post-M5 polish.

### Session 14d — M4: the phone is the AI (on-device model, measured + integrated) (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

#### The spike — measured on bare metal before integrating anything

Cross-compiled llama.cpp's `llama-bench` for arm64 (NDK 27.1, `GGML_OPENMP=OFF` — the phone has no libomp), pushed to `/data/local/tmp`, ran on the A15 5G:

| Model | Weights | Prompt eval | Generation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 3 1B Q4_K_M (4 threads) | 762 MiB | 16.56 tok/s | **10.11 tok/s** | PICKED |
| Gemma 3 1B Q4_K_M (6 threads) | 762 MiB | 20.54 tok/s | 9.24 tok/s | tg regresses (big.LITTLE) |
| Qwen3-1.7B Q4_K_M (4 threads) | 1.19 GiB | 10.10 tok/s | 6.70 tok/s | not worth 2× memory |

10 tok/s = ~20s for a 200-token agent decision — workable for background steps; chat is functional. The gate research's capability ladder says 1B won't drive a reliable multi-step tool loop, so the design lands exactly as measured: **cloud drives the tool loop; the on-device model is the offline brain and fast path.**

#### Integration

- `app/src/main/cpp/ultra_llm.cpp` + CMake — JNI shim against llama.cpp static libs (staged at `~/llama-android/{lib,include}`, build recipe: clone llama.cpp, cmake with the NDK android toolchain for arm64, `-DGGML_OPENMP=OFF`, copy `libllama.a`/`libggml*.a` + headers). API: load(path, threads, ctx) → handle; generate(handle, prompt, maxTokens, temp, tokenCallback) streams pieces; free.
- `local/LlmNative.kt` + `local/LocalModelEngine.kt` — model at `files/models/gemma3-1b-q4km.gguf` (adb-staged via run-as), `ensureLoaded()` memory guard (ActivityManager availMem ≥ 500MB — **mmap'd weights are pageable; the first guard used `_SC_AVPHYS_PAGES` and refused wrongly**; logging shows avail/need), 4 threads, 4K ctx.
- Hybrid routing in Brain: no provider → local; cloud call fails → "(cloud unreachable — answering on-device)" → local. `/local <text>` forces on-device from the chat box.
- Model delivery for dev: `adb push` to /data/local/tmp, then `run-as com.agent.ultra cp` into app storage. A first-run download flow is the product path (noted, not built).

#### Verification (PROVEN on device, screenshots)

- Load: 2.9s, ctx 4096, 4 threads (logcat UltraLlm).
- `/local what is the capital of france` → "The capital of France is Paris." — on-device, streamed.
- **Full offline test: airplane mode ON + `svc wifi disable` + no SIM** → "what color is the sky today" → cloud call fails → fallback notice → "**Blue.**" The app carried its brain through a dead network.

#### Harness notes (so they never cost time again)

- Play Protect "Don't send" dialog appears on most installs with variable delay; the install script dismisses it but still misses sometimes — verify `dumpsys package … lastUpdateTime` actually changed before testing (one silent no-op install cost a stale-code test run).
- An "Android App Compatibility" system dialog appeared once after the native-lib build; dismissed with "Don't Show Again".
- adb harness: `input text` needs `%s` for spaces; RN screens are invisible to uiautomator but Compose screens are fully dumpable; `uitap.sh` + `install.sh` in this repo's tooling dir are the reliable tap-by-text and install primitives.

### Session 14c — M3: the gatellml policy gate runs on the phone (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

#### What was done

- **`gate/` package — a faithful Kotlin port of gatellml's measured runtime** (origins/contracts/manifest/runtime, one file each, semantics identical to the Python): origins mint by substring-membership against the user's request; deny-by-default for undeclared tools; taint-egress; the 8 contract kinds; structured block-and-continue messages.
- `assets/ultra.manifest.json` — every brain tool declared with effects and contracts (the vacuity lesson: completeness is mandatory). sms_send = egress + recipient_traceable(to) + not_tainted(message) + spoof_check; open_url = egress + domain_in_request(url); web_search = egress + not_tainted(query) + spoof_check; reads uncontracted; device toggles mutate-uncontracted.
- Brain wiring: one `Gate.Episode` per user request; `enforceCall` before execution; blocks return the research's BLOCK message as the tool result and the episode continues; secrets from tool results accumulate per-episode (`observeSecrets`).
- **Unit tests: 12/12 pass** — the 11 cases from gatellml's `test_lang.py` ported verdict-for-verdict, plus one regression test from the live device finding below.

#### Live device findings (the gate earning its keep)

1. **False positive caught on-device:** "open google.com" → model sent `url=https://www.google.com` → `domain_in_request` blocked it (`www.google.com` ∉ "open google.com"). Same class as the research's display-name gap. Fixed at the contract level: leading `www.` normalized away on both sides; `AnyArgTraceable` extended to atom/domain-token-level traces for model paraphrases. Regression test: `wwwPrefixNormalizedOnDeviceCase`.
2. **After the fix, both directions verified live:** the identical call now passes and the page opens; untraced domains still block (unit-level).
3. Observed: model self-escalated to `react_navigate {goal:"search for weather"}` unasked. Gate allowed it — appHint traced to the request. Mission creep is a model-quality issue, not a gate gap; noted.
4. Harness lesson: Play Protect dialog timing varies; installs must verify `lastUpdateTime` actually changed (one "successful" install silently hadn't landed and a test ran stale code).

#### Status

- Gate: **PROVEN** (unit parity + live block + live allow).
- The old auto-approve confirmation stub is now UX-only ("About to: …"); the deterministic gate is the enforcement layer.
- Known honest limits (from the research, still true here): Tier-B speech-act injections (the model merely repeating a poisoned sentence) are unreachable by any tool-mediating gate; the referential-target flow ("text mom" where the number comes from contacts_read) blocks until the user confirms the number — by design, to be addressed by a resolve/confirm channel later.

### Session 14b — M2 core: the brain loop runs on the native build (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

#### What was done

- `provider/ProviderConfig.kt` — SharedPreferences-backed, dev-seeds once from `Android/data/.../files/ultra_provider.json` (adb-pushable; keeps key entry automatable with zero UI taps).
- `provider/OpenAiClient.kt` — minimal OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` client (OkHttp). Proven against OpenRouter `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` (same model family as the Venice-proven Build 29 brain).
- `agent/AgentController.kt` — in-process device layer replacing the RN bridge: a11y service calls (screenFlat/tap/swipe/type/scroll/ime/back/home), app launch + fuzzy package find, flashlight, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND (notification-policy path with zen_mode fallback), volume, SMS, battery/device info.
- `agent/Tools.kt` — the dispatcher: read_text_on_screen, describe_screen, app_launch, open_url, react_navigate, web_search (DuckDuckGo scrape ported verbatim), device_info, battery_status, system_info, flashlight/wifi/bluetooth/dnd toggles, volume_set, sms_send. Failures start with `Error:` per the brain's success heuristic.
- `agent/ReActNavigator.kt` — perceive→think→act→verify: indexed TAPPABLE/TYPEABLE/SCROLLABLE observation lists, `ACTION:`/bare-line parsing, tap-by-index via coordinates, empty-selector typing into the focused field + IME submit, stuck detector with scroll recovery, 15-iteration budget, done-gating that rejects completion off the target app.
- `agent/Brain.kt` — the 12-turn loop ported from BrainExecutor.ts: same system-prompt shape, balanced-JSON tool parsing, dynamic maxTokens (2000/1500/2500), push-once follow-through, same-tool-twice stuck stop, structured `[RESULT]` feedback. **Fix-in-port #1 (conversation bleed):** history window is rebuilt fresh per request from the last 8 visible chat messages, 4KB char cap — tool traces never enter it.
- ChatScreen wires Send → `brain.run()` on a coroutine with a thinking state.

#### Verification (PROVEN on device, logcat + screenshots)

- "what is the battery level" → `TOOL CALL: battery_status` → `Battery: 100% (charging)` → correct spoken answer. Full model→tool→device→answer loop.
- "open chrome" → `app_launch {Chrome}` launched; model self-escalated to `react_navigate {goal: go to google.com}`; navigator's tap on Chrome's UI dispatched and completed (perception+action through the ported service PROVEN) but the perception stream went `root=null` mid-navigation and the navigator exhausted its budget with an honest error; the brain then recovered via `open_url` and google.com loaded (screenshot).

#### Known gaps (named, not hidden)

- `SCREEN_FLAT: root=null` bursts during app transitions — the window scan and root fallback both went null for several seconds while Chrome settled. Needs retry/backoff in observe() (SOURCE-IDENTIFIED, fix not yet shipped).
- The confirmation gate for destructive tools currently logs and continues ("auto-approved in this build") — M3's policy gate replaces it; do not ship beyond dev before that lands.
- sms_read/contacts_read/device_location and the rest of the proven catalog not yet ported.
- First-send quirk in the harness (not the app): `adb shell input text` needs `%s` for spaces.

### Session 14 — M1: native Kotlin skeleton lives on device (2026-08-27, branch `native`)

- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Device Control), H (Build/Release)
- **Strategic context:** Owner direction — Ultra becomes the AI, not an API client (the Mind Meld pattern: deterministic spine + shipped model + validation gate). Native Kotlin rewrite begun; Expo app stays on `main` at Build 30.

#### What was done

- New `ultra-native/` Gradle project (AGP 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.0.21, Compose BOM 2024.12.01, JDK 17 — Aundrea's proven versions). Package `com.agent.ultra`, versionCode 6 / `2.0.0-native`.
- **Ported the two proven Java services out of the Expo plugin into plain Android sources:**
  - `AgentAccessibilityService.java` (57KB) — 4-point surgery only: removed 3 RN imports + the one `DeviceEventEmitter` emit site, replaced with a `UiTreeListener` interface. Everything else byte-identical.
  - `AgentBackgroundService.java` — verbatim (zero RN coupling).
  - The RN bridge classes (`AccessibilityBridgeModule`, `AgentNativePackage`, `AgentHeadlessTaskService`) are intentionally NOT ported — Kotlin code will call the service directly in-process. On-device APK build chain (ApkPackager/Signer) also not ported; its role in the native architecture is an open decision, documented not deleted (still in the plugin on `main`).
- Compose chat shell: `MainActivity` + `ChatScreen` (message list, input, send) + dark-only theme (matches the app's established identity) + live a11y status line. Brain stub returns a marker line; real wiring is M2.
- Signing: Expo project's debug keystore copied to `ultra-native/app/debug.keystore` and used for all build types — install-over continuity confirmed on device (v1.3.1 → v2.0.0-native with no uninstall).

#### Device findings that cost time (so they never cost it again)

1. **Play Protect dialog on first install of the new signature class** — "Send app for a security check?" Chose Don't send; install proceeded.
2. **Android 16 restricted-settings enforcement silently reverts a11y enables** for shell-installed apps (`settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services` reads back null; the settings-UI toggle + Allow dialog silently no-ops). `appops set … ACCESS_RESTRICTED_SETTINGS allow` alone is NOT sufficient on this build.
   **Fix that holds: reinstall with the installer recorded as Play Store — `adb install -r -i com.android.vending <apk>`** — after which `settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services …` sticks.
3. **Force-stop still reverts the a11y enable on this device.** Workflow rule: after any `am force-stop`, re-run the two `settings put` lines. Fully scriptable; no manual step ever again:

```
adb install -r -i com.android.vending ultra-native/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.agent.ultra/com.agent.ultra.AgentAccessibilityService
adb shell settings put secure accessibility_enabled 1
```

#### Verification (all PROVEN on the A15 5G, screenshots on file)

- `./gradlew assembleDebug` — first build 1m14s, incremental 5s. APK 12.5MB (vs Expo's 128MB).
- Install-over Build 30 succeeded; app launches to the chat shell (title, dark theme, input, Send).
- **Perception live:** a11y service bound (`dumpsys accessibility`), prefs `state=connected`, logcat `AgentA11y: PKG_CHANGE: -> com.android.chrome` when Chrome opened.
- UI status line reflects service state live ("agent: ready").
- Known cosmetic caveat: first screenshot iteration had the title invisible (light-scheme text on black window) — fixed by forcing the dark scheme; Compose semantics (uiautomator) see everything regardless.

#### Open / next (M2)

- Port the brain: 12-turn tool loop + tool registry + ReActLoop in Kotlin, calling the a11y service in-process (no bridge). Fix-in-port list from Build 29: conversation bleed between tasks, self-interaction over-blocking, BT/DND via direct settings API, SMS `to=undefined`.
- AI provider config: no key on the device yet; needed for first brain test.

### Session 13 — Build 30: biometric gate removed + permission-onboarding fix (2026-08-27)

- **Date:** 2026-08-27
- **Subsystems:** E (Permissions/Security), H (Build/Release)
- **Device:** Galaxy A15 5G (SM-S156V, Dimensity 6100+, 3.5GB RAM, Android 16) over USB adb — new test device, replacing the S25 as the bench target.

#### What was done

**BiometricGate removed entirely (owner directive: no gates between the agent and automation).**
- Deleted `src/security/BiometricGate.ts` (only consumer of `expo-local-authentication`).
- `app/index.tsx`: removed the startup `authenticateIfNeeded` call, the `isAppLocked` state + ref, the full-screen lock overlay, and `lockStyles`.
- `app/settings.tsx`: removed the "App Lock" card, `biometricGate`/`lockTimeout` state, and `initBiometric`.
- `app.json`: removed `USE_BIOMETRIC`/`USE_FINGERPRINT` permissions and the `expo-local-authentication` plugin. Version 1.3.0→1.3.1, versionCode 4→5.
- Repo-wide grep + `tsc --noEmit` both clean after removal.

**Permission-onboarding bug found and fixed (same class as the biometric wall — a gate blocking automation).**
- Root cause: `PermissionBroker` used RN `PermissionsAndroid.check()` for `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, which always returns false for special-access permissions → the app deep-linked to the system "All files access" page on EVERY cold start, granted or not.
- Fix: new native method `isAllFilesAccessGranted()` in the plugin's AgentNativeModule template (`plugins/withAgentNative.js`) calling `Environment.isExternalStorageManager()`; wrapper added in `src/native/AgentNative.ts`; both checks in PermissionBroker routed through it.

**Build pipeline: EAS login removed from the loop.** `eas whoami` = not logged in, and signing was the only thing EAS cloud provided. Built with `npx expo prebuild --clean` + `cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease` — release signed with the template debug keystore, no Expo account needed. ~8 min clean, ~3 min incremental.

#### Verification (all PROVEN on device, screenshots on file)

- Build 30 (v1.3.1/vc5) installed on the A15 5G; `tsc` 0 errors.
- Force-stop → cold start lands directly on the chat UI: no lock screen, no permission dialog, no settings redirect (mCurrentFocus = com.agent.ultra.MainActivity, visually confirmed).
- All runtime permissions granted via `pm grant`; WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS granted; MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE appop allow; battery-optimization whitelist added (`dumpsys deviceidle whitelist +com.agent.ultra`).
- **Accessibility service enabled via adb** (`settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services com.agent.ultra/com.agent.ultra.AgentAccessibilityService`) — the old manual re-enable step is now automated.

#### Open / next

- No AI provider configured on this install ("Add AI provider" status shown) — needed before brain testing.
- Native Kotlin rewrite begins next (branch `native`): ports the Java accessibility service out of the Expo plugin; brain, gate, and on-device model follow. Expo app stays on `main`, untouched from here.

### Session 12 — Brain Intelligence Upgrade + IME Fix (2026-04-08 through 2026-04-09)

- **Date:** 2026-04-08 to 2026-04-09
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control), H (Build/Release)

#### What was done

Full brain architecture audit followed by 8-priority intelligence upgrade, informed by academic research (UI-TARS, AutoDroid, Mobile-Agent-E, ReCAP).

**P1 — System prompt restructured (BrainExecutor.ts):**
- Tools grouped into 8 categories (DEVICE CONTROL, APPS & NAVIGATION, INFORMATION, etc.) with 1-line descriptions
- Dynamic state (PHONE STATE, KNOWN ABOUT USER) moved to top of prompt
- Rules reduced from ~15 mixed paragraphs to 8 numbered items
- Tool reliability ranking added: direct tools > app_launch > react_navigate
- Prompt size reduced from ~4.5KB to ~3.7KB
- TOOL SELECTION decision tree removed (was a crutch, model selects correctly with descriptive names)
- SELF-EVOLUTION, AUTO-FILL, DEVICE AWARENESS prose sections cut

**P2 — Context window expanded (BrainExecutor.ts):**
- Sliding window: 12KB budget (was 8KB), 10 recent messages (was 6)
- Tool results get 3KB limit (was 2KB) — they contain actionable data
- First user message always preserved (brain never forgets what it was asked)
- Same-role messages separated with `---` instead of merged (preserves semantic boundaries)

**P3 — Task planning added (BrainExecutor.ts):**
- `isMultiStepIntent()` detects compound tasks (2+ action verbs, connectors like "and then")
- `planTask()` calls LLM once to produce 2-5 step JSON plan before tool loop
- Plan injected into context; current step pointer advances on success
- Single-step tasks skip planning (no overhead)
- PROVEN in logs: generated plans like `web_search → device_location → react_navigate → app_launch` and followed them step by step

**P4 — Structured tool feedback (BrainExecutor.ts):**
- `buildToolFeedback()` produces: `[RESULT: tool] STATUS: success/failed`, `TURNS_LEFT: N/12`, `CURRENT_STEP: N/M`
- Post-action verification prompt for react_navigate results
- Web search special handling: "Answer directly, do NOT open browser"
- Generic "Continue solving..." boilerplate removed

**P5 — Dynamic maxTokens (BrainExecutor.ts):**
- Turn 0: 2000 tokens (initial reasoning)
- Turns 1-10: 1500 tokens (tool calls are short)
- Final turn (11+): 2500 tokens (synthesis answer)

**P6 — Task memory (BrainExecutor.ts):**
- `TaskMemory` stored in AsyncStorage with tool reliability + task shortcuts
- `recordToolResult()` tracks per-tool success/failure counts
- `recordTaskShortcut()` saves successful multi-step tool sequences
- `getTaskMemoryHints()` injects reliability warnings and known approaches into system prompt
- Max 20 shortcuts stored, pruned by usage count

**P7 — ReActLoop improvements (ReActLoop.ts):**
- LLM prompt upgraded: reasoning requirement (`ACTION: tap(5) // reason`), negative examples, type hints on node labels (`(button)`, `(menu-item)`, `(input)`)
- Visible-only element filtering: nodes with `y < 0` or `y > screenHeight` excluded from observation
- Action extraction strips `// reason` comments from `ACTION:` prefix responses

**P8 — WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS (withAgentNative.js, TaskExecutor.ts, AppController.ts):**
- `setSecureSetting(namespace, key, value)` and `getSecureSetting(namespace, key)` added to Java bridge
- Toggle handlers try direct API first (`Settings.Global.putInt()`), fall back to QS automation
- Airplane mode broadcasts `ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED` after setting change
- `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` added to app.json permissions
- Grant command: `adb -s <device-ip>:5555 shell pm grant com.agent.ultra android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`

**IME_ENTER triple fallback (withAgentNative.js, ReActLoop.ts):**
- Strategy 1: `ACTION_IME_ENTER` on focused editable node (original)
- Strategy 2: `ACTION_IME_ENTER` on ANY editable node + `ACTION_CLICK` fallback (catches keyboard-stole-focus case)
- Strategy 3: Gesture tap on keyboard's Search/Go/Enter button via accessibility tree scan
- `findAnyEditable()` — finds editable nodes regardless of focus state
- `findKeyboardEnter()` — scans IME window for Enter/Search/Go/Done buttons
- 200ms delay between type and IME (let keyboard process), retry after 500ms if first attempt fails

**Bug fixes during testing:**
- SMS `to=undefined` — params restored for sms_send, react_navigate, web_search, contacts_read in TOOLS string (had been removed in P1)
- Over-searching — "MAX 2 web_searches per task" added to rules
- Build failure — `ACTION_ARGUMENT_IME_ACTION_ID` invalid symbol removed, replaced with `ACTION_CLICK` fallback

#### Builds this session

| Build | Commit | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| 27 | 4a8c932 | P1-P8 brain upgrade (all 8 priorities) |
| 28 | 337d851 | SMS params fix + search cap + WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS in manifest |
| 29 | e8a1ced | IME_ENTER triple fallback + Java compile fix |

#### Test results (Build 27, logcat analysis)

| Test | Tools used | Result | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gas search + navigate (1st) | PLAN(4) → web_search → device_location → react_navigate → app_launch → PUSH → open_url → react_navigate → read_text_on_screen → 4x web_search | Brain followed plan but over-searched (7 total) | Over-searching |
| Gas search + navigate (2nd) | web_search → web_search → web_search → react_navigate → web_search | 4 searches, gave up with text | Over-searching |
| Camera | camera_capture | PASS | — |
| Multi-step (5-step) | PLAN(5) → react_navigate → do_not_disturb → device_info → system_info → note_create → PUSH → react_navigate → open_url | All 5 plan steps followed | 59s + 30s latency spikes |
| SMS | sms_send(to=undefined) → contacts_read → sms_send(to=undefined) | FAIL × 3 | Params missing from TOOLS |

#### Test results (Build 29, partial)

| Test | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Flashlight on | PASS | Brain selected flashlight_toggle, executed correctly |
| Amazon "order gpu" | Brain worked | react_navigate → Amazon launched, HeadlessJS ran, ReActLoop iterated inside Amazon UI |
| WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS | UNVERIFIED | Permission granted via pm grant, but bluetooth toggle not tested |
| IME_ENTER | UNVERIFIED | Code deployed but no Chrome search test run |

#### Session 12 honest assessment

**What improved (PROVEN):**
- Brain now plans multi-step tasks before executing (P3)
- Context window holds 27+ messages without losing the original goal (P2)
- System prompt is 20% smaller and better structured (P1)
- Dynamic token allocation matches task phase (P5)
- Task memory infrastructure in place (P6)

**What's SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN:**
- IME_ENTER triple fallback (deployed but no Chrome test)
- WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS direct toggles (bridge added but toggle test inconclusive)
- SMS params fix (TOOLS updated but no sms_send test on Build 28+)
- Over-searching cap (rule added but no test)
- Visible-only element filtering in ReActLoop

**What's still broken:**
- Bluetooth/DND QS toggle — Samsung split tile tap doesn't actually toggle
- Conversation context bleeds between tasks
- Brain took 2 turns to select flashlight_toggle (plain text first, then PUSH, then correct tool) — was 1 turn on Build 26

**Developer status:** Exhausted, questioning whether to continue. Real concerns: Google Play accessibility policy may block distribution, Android 17 Advanced Protection Mode threatens the approach, execution layer (toggles, IME) prevents end-to-end reliability despite brain improvements.

**Revert point:** `git revert HEAD~2` to return to Build 26 (7603aa3) if brain regressions confirmed.

#### What to pick up if continuing

1. Test IME_ENTER on Chrome search — this is the gate for proving brain + execution work together
2. Verify WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS bluetooth toggle — `adb shell settings get global bluetooth_on` before/after
3. Test SMS with restored params
4. Fix conversation bleed — clear/reset context between unrelated tasks
5. Investigate why flashlight takes 2 turns instead of 1 (possible prompt regression)

- **Status:** PARTIALLY PROVEN. Brain intelligence upgrades deployed and working (planning, context, feedback). Execution layer fixes deployed but unverified. Multiple known issues remain.
- **Next:** Verify execution layer fixes (IME, toggles, SMS) or reassess project direction.

### Session 11 — Code Audit + Bug Fixes + Testing (2026-04-07)

- **Date:** 2026-04-07
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control), H (Build/Release)

#### Phase 1: Code Audit — 9 bugs found and fixed

Full code audit of BrainExecutor, ReActLoop, TaskExecutor, HeadlessReActHandler, AppController, AgentNative, index.tsx. Bugs found and fixed:

1. **image_generate** used raw user message (`request`) instead of LLM's `params.prompt` — fixed to `params.prompt || request`
2. **weather** TOOLS definition said `city` but handler checked `params.location` — handler now accepts both, TOOLS updated to `location`
3. **sms_send** contacts lookup ran even after recall resolved a phone number — added phone-number guard
4. **memory_recall** hallucinated via LLM instead of querying KnowledgeGraph — replaced with real graph + vault lookup
5. **ReActLoop self-interaction** check skipped first 3 iterations (should be 1) — changed to `iteration === 1`
6. **Approval flow** dropped `pendingState` — destructive actions silently never executed after user approved — pendingState now saved and passed through
7. **Flashlight toggle** state tracking simplified
8. **Stop button cancellation** — ReActLoop now has `cancel()` method with `_cancelled` flag checked each iteration. HeadlessReActHandler listens for `cancelReActLoop` DeviceEventEmitter event. Stop button emits the event.
9. **URL hallucination guard** — react_navigate validates URL-like appHints against known domain whitelist. Unknown domains rejected, browser opened instead. Brain prompt instructs LLM to never invent URLs.

Committed as `a92a64b` (Build 14).

#### Phase 2: Build 14 Testing — 7 pass, 3 bugs found

Build 14 installed via wireless ADB (`<device-ip>:5555`). Systematic testing:

| Test | Tool | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic chat | (none) | **PASS** | 2.0s plain text response |
| Battery level | (environment) | **PASS** | Answered from phone state context in system prompt |
| WiFi toggle | wifi_toggle | **PASS** | Actually toggled WiFi off (killed wireless ADB!) |
| Bluetooth toggle | bluetooth_toggle | **PASS** | Full end-to-end, split tile detected, 2.1s |
| Flashlight ON | flashlight_toggle | **PASS** | 2.4s |
| Flashlight OFF | flashlight_toggle | **FAIL** | LLM sends no `state` param, toggle goes wrong direction |
| Device info | device_info | **PASS** | "Samsung Galaxy S25, SM-S156V, Android 16" |
| Volume set | volume_set | **PASS** | Set to 53% (closest to 50%) |

Bugs found during testing:

1. **Flashlight OFF fails** — LLM sends `flashlight_toggle` without `state:"off"`, so toggle direction is based on stale `_flashlightOn` boolean. **FIXED:** infer on/off from request text (`/\b(off|disable)\b/`)
2. **Brain calls react_navigate after simple toggles** — after flashlight_toggle succeeds, brain calls react_navigate to "verify" in Settings, wasting 3 minutes. **FIXED:** added prompt instruction "After a toggle or simple action succeeds, STOP and tell the user it's done."
3. **isServiceEnabled() false positive** — returns false after force-stop even though service IS enabled (confirmed via `adb shell settings get secure enabled_accessibility_services`). Caused by `catch` block swallowing Settings.Secure read failure and returning false. **FIXED:** separated Settings.Secure check from instance check, Settings.Secure is authoritative.
4. **react_navigate to Settings disables accessibility** — navigating to Accessibility settings screen toggled the service off. **FIXED:** TaskExecutor rejects goals/appHints containing "accessibility"/"quick settings". ReActLoop detects accessibility settings screen and aborts.
5. **Stuck react_navigate blocks new messages** — 300s timeout means user waits 5 minutes. Stop button cancel was in code but untested on this build.

All 5 bugs fixed, committed as `e70de49` (Build 15).

#### Phase 3: Build 15 — COMPILING (in progress)

#### Build 15-16 Testing — Context Poisoning Bug Found

Build 15 installed and tested. **isServiceEnabled false positive FIXED** — no more false "disabled" warnings.

**CRITICAL BUG:** Model stopped calling tools entirely — responded as plain text for ALL requests (flashlight, battery, volume). Root cause: conversation history contained plain-text assistant replies that taught the model to continue responding as text instead of JSON tool calls. **FIXED in Build 16:** `buildContextFromConversation` now filters out plain-text-only assistant messages, keeping only tool-call exchanges. Also merges consecutive same-role messages to maintain API role alternation.

**Build 16 verified:** After context filter fix, model correctly selected `flashlight_toggle` on first turn. But then called `react_navigate` to Settings as follow-up (wasting time and causing stuck loops).

**Build 17 fixes:**
1. Brain prompt CRITICAL RULES: after toggle/simple action, next response MUST be plain text (no more follow-up tools)
2. Brain prompt: NEVER use react_navigate to go to Settings
3. ReActLoop: Samsung `com.android.settings.intelligence` treated as same app as `com.android.settings` (was causing infinite wrong-app relaunch loop)

#### Builds 18-21 — Inference-First Tool Routing

**Build 18:** Added one-shot examples to brain prompt. Model still picked wrong tools.

**Build 19:** Added `inferToolFromText()` — deterministic intent detection from user input. Covers all 48 tools. When model responds as plain text, inference catches it and calls the right tool. Tested: flashlight on/off, weather, web search all PASS.

**Build 20:** Expanded inference to cover ALL tools (toggles, volume, brightness, media, weather, web search, news, battery, device/system info, location, SMS, contacts, clipboard, files, share, alarms, timers, reminders, calendar, notes, camera, screenshot, screen record, image gen, TTS, screen reading, notifications, user profile, memory, app install, app info, URLs, react_navigate, app launch).

**Build 21 (DEPLOYED):** **Inference-first strategy** — on turn 0, deterministic inference OVERRIDES the model's JSON tool choice. The model consistently picks wrong tools (e.g. `web_search` for "open calculator", `flashlight_toggle` for "set volume to 40"). Inference corrects every one. On follow-up turns (after tool result), model's choice is trusted.

**Key insight:** `inferToolFromText` is now the primary tool router. The LLM is relegated to handling ambiguous/complex requests that inference can't pattern-match, and providing natural language responses after tool execution. This makes Agent Ultra model-agnostic — works regardless of model quality.

#### Session 11 End — Builds 24-26

**Build 24:** Approval message now saves to conversation and renders in chat. Previously invisible.

**Build 25:** Brain follow-through push. When the user asks for an ACTION but the brain returns descriptive text after running a tool, the loop pushes the model back in: "You described what to do but didn't do it. Use a tool to actually complete the action." Fires once per request, only after at least one tool has run. Addresses SKILLS_REFERENCE Failure Class F (autonomy theater).

**Build 26:** Auth wall exceptions. "Sign in to save your searches" and similar suggestion banners in Maps/Chrome no longer trigger auth_required abort. Maps navigation works on unsigned-in devices.

**Test results (Build 26, clean install):**
- "find me the cheapest gas station near me and navigate me there"
  - Brain selected react_navigate → Maps → directions screen appeared with route
  - Second run: brain got pushed → selected react_navigate with appHint "GasBuddy" and goal "show cheapest gas stations in Girard, OH" — knew the right app and user's city
  - Execution stopped at Google search bar — typed query but IME_ENTER didn't fire (cursor blinked, no submit)
  - Brain reasoning: PROVEN. Execution layer (ReActLoop IME): BLOCKED.

**Next session priorities (in order):**
1. Fix IME_ENTER in ReActLoop — text gets typed but never submitted
2. Fix self-interaction detection — too aggressive, blocks gallery/photos
3. Continue testing remaining tools (camera, image gen, TTS, file ops, etc.)
4. Progress feedback UI — user sees "Processing..." for minutes with no indication of what's happening
5. Public-ready polish (onboarding, settings UX, offline handling, error messages)

#### Session 11 POSTMORTEM — What Went Wrong (Builds 16-22)

Claude Code spent the session progressively breaking a working brain by over-engineering tool routing:
- Build 16: Filtered conversation context — removed examples that taught the model the tool-call pattern
- Builds 17-18: Added CRITICAL RULES, one-shot EXAMPLES — bloated prompt from 9KB to 11KB, confused the model
- Builds 19-21: Bypassed the brain entirely with `inferToolFromText` override — turned the agent into a command parser (Siri with extra steps)
- Builds 22: Fixed regex bugs in the inference system that shouldn't have existed

**Root cause:** Treated tool routing failures as a code problem. It was a model behavior issue that should have been investigated, not worked around. Each "fix" made the brain dumber.

**Build 23 reverts to Session 10 prompt** — clean, simple, working. All real bug fixes kept (approval flow, self-interaction, accessibility, Samsung settings, flashlight state, URL guard, stop button). Inference kept as fallback only.

**LESSON:** The brain is the product. Never sacrifice reasoning for plumbing. Test thinking first, not toggles.

#### Build 21 Test Results (HISTORICAL — inference-override era, DO NOT replicate this approach)

| # | Test | Model wanted | Inference overrode to | Result |

2. Offline handling (detect no internet, tell user)
3. Error recovery UI (friendly messages, not raw errors)
4. Notification listener (real notification access)
5. Brightness control (native, not settings redirect)
6. Onboarding screen
7. User-friendly settings (hide API jargon, guided setup)
8. New chat flow that properly resets context

- **Status:** Build 15 COMPILING. Build 14 partially tested (7/48 tools). 5 bugs found and fixed. SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN for Build 15 fixes.
- **Next:** Install Build 15, continue systematic testing of all remaining tools.

### Session 10 — Autonomous Work Session (in progress)

- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Device Control), A (Brain/Cognition), H (Build/Release)
- **Mode:** Autonomous — user away, full ADB access

#### Fixes implemented

**Fix 1 — Samsung split QS tile toggle (WiFi/BT/Airplane)**
- Root cause: Samsung One UI QS tiles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, and Airplane mode are SPLIT tiles — the left side (icon) toggles on/off, the right side (text label) opens the settings screen. Previous code found the "Wi-Fi" text node, walked up to the clickable ancestor, and tapped its center — which hit the text/settings side.
- Fix: Detect split tiles by checking if the clickable ancestor is wider than 2x its height. If so, tap the LEFT QUARTER of the bounds (icon/toggle zone) instead of center. Always use gesture tap instead of ACTION_CLICK for QS tiles (ACTION_CLICK often routes to the settings action on Samsung).
- File: `plugins/withAgentNative.js` tapQuickSettingsTile()

**Fix 2 — Silent handler logging (sms_send, camera_capture)**
- Added `console.warn('[TASK] ...')` breadcrumbs at entry, key decision points, and exit for sms_send and camera_capture handlers. Previous DebugLog calls only wrote to internal JS buffer, invisible in adb logcat.
- File: `src/core/TaskExecutor.ts`

**Fix 3 — react_navigate app re-launch recovery**
- Previous: when wrong app detected, pressed Back (useless if app closed entirely — ends up on launcher).
- Fix: when wrong app detected, re-launches expectedPkg via `AgentNative.launchApp()` instead of pressing Back. Falls back to Back if launchApp fails.
- File: `src/core/ReActLoop.ts`

#### Build status
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- WSL rsync complete
- npm install in progress (node_modules was corrupted, running clean install)
- EAS build not yet started — waiting for npm install

#### Runtime Test Results (Build 1 — Session 10)

**Build pipeline fixed:** WSL needs `ANDROID_HOME=~/android` (Linux SDK), not `/mnt/c/Android` (Windows SDK has .bat files, not executables). Also needs `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` for node/npm and `eas-cli` installed globally.

**API Latency SOLVED:** Brain API call took **1.2 seconds** for "turn off wifi" → wifi_toggle selection. NOT 30-40 seconds. The previous "model is slow" theory was definitively wrong. `resolveRoute: 0ms`, `fetch_done: 1264ms`, `json_parse: 3ms`. Venice/llama-3.3-70b is fast when the request is properly sized (5838 bytes for brain, 601 bytes for proactive).

**WiFi toggle — PARTIAL SUCCESS:**
- LLM correctly selected `wifi_toggle` tool (not react_navigate!)
- QS shade pulled down successfully (`swipe_shade result=true`)
- QS expanded successfully (`swipe_expand result=true`)
- `findAccessibilityNodeInfosByText("Wi-Fi")` found 1 match — but it was the STATUS BAR indicator at y=388, not the actual QS tile
- Split tile detection fired correctly, gesture_tap returned true
- **But WiFi did not actually toggle** — the tap hit the status bar Wi-Fi indicator (y=388), not the QS tile
- Root cause: y<400 filter was too low, all real candidates were filtered out, code fell back to the status bar node

**Fix applied (Build 2):**
- Raised y threshold from 400 to 500
- When all nodes filtered, picks the node with HIGHEST y (furthest from status bar) instead of using unfiltered list
- Added Samsung QS suffix search ("Wi-Fi, Connected", "Wi-Fi, On", etc.) since Samsung tiles often include state in their labels

#### Build 2 Runtime Test — Bluetooth Toggle PROVEN

**bluetooth_toggle end-to-end: PROVEN.** User said "turn off bluetooth" → LLM picked `bluetooth_toggle` in 1.1s → QS shade opened → tile found (5 matches, status bar filtered, best_y=407 selected) → SPLIT_TILE detected → gesture_tap at icon side (669,407) → result=true → shade dismissed → Bluetooth state confirmed OFF via `adb shell settings get global bluetooth_on` = 0. Total: ~7 seconds.

**API latency DEFINITIVELY SOLVED:** Brain call 1.1s, not 30-40s. Same model (llama-3.3-70b), same provider (Venice). The previous "model is slow" theory spanning Sessions 8-9 was wrong.

#### Build 2 Runtime Test — Chrome Search (Partial)

**react_navigate selected correctly in 2.1s.** Chrome launched. HeadlessJS fired. But:
- Iteration 1 read Agent Ultra's UI (38 nodes) — moveTaskToBack hadn't completed yet
- Iteration 2 saw Chrome's tab groups tooltip (1 node: "You can now easily add tabs to groups here")
- Sparse screen triggered expensive vision API call instead of dismissing the dialog
- Chrome was visible briefly with "Search Google or type URL" on iteration 1 but the agent was still on Agent Ultra's window

#### Additional fixes for Build 4 (in progress)

1. **Wait for target app** — ReActLoop polls `getActivePackage()` up to 5 seconds until expectedPkg is in foreground before first observation
2. **Sparse screen overlay dismiss** — When nodes ≤ 3, press Back to dismiss dialog/tooltip instead of calling vision API
3. **parseGoal fix** — "search for weather in alaska" was being truncated to "weather" by the "in/on" suffix regex. Fixed to capture the full query.
4. **findSearchField clickable fallback** — Chrome's "Search Google or type URL" is clickable but not editable. New fallback finds clickable nodes with search-like labels when no editable fields exist.
5. **Implicit search pattern** — Goals containing "search" anywhere now parse as search action

#### Build 5 — Chrome Weather Search: PROVEN END-TO-END

**"search for weather in alaska on chrome" → Google weather results displayed.**

Full autonomous pipeline:
1. Brain selected `react_navigate` in ~2s
2. Chrome launched via `launchApp(com.android.chrome)`
3. HeadlessJS waited for Chrome foreground (`target_app_ready after 1000ms`)
4. Read Chrome homepage (31 nodes, "Search Google or type URL" visible)
5. Deterministic path tapped search bar
6. Typed "weather in alaska" (parseGoal fix captured full query)
7. IME_ENTER fired via window-scanning `performImeAction` (Build 5 fix)
8. Google search submitted, weather results displayed

**Build 5 fixes that enabled this:**
- `performImeAction` scans all TYPE_APPLICATION windows (not just keyboard window)
- Wait for target app in foreground before first observation
- Sparse screen overlay dismiss (Back instead of vision API)
- `parseGoal` captures full query ("weather in alaska" not truncated)
- `findSearchField` clickable fallback for Chrome's URL bar

**Logcat buffer overflow prevented full trace capture** — need to increase buffer or reduce non-essential logging in future builds.

#### Build 6 — Multi-Step Task: PROVEN

**"turn on bluetooth then search for pizza on chrome" → Brain chained 4 tools across 4 turns:**

| Turn | Tool | Duration | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app_launch` (Chrome) | 4.3s | Chrome opened |
| 2 | `react_navigate` (search weather alaska) | 80s (outlier) | Typed + IME submitted, search results shown |
| 3 | `bluetooth_toggle` | 1.9s | QS tile tapped, BT toggled |
| 4 | `react_navigate` (search pizza) | 1.6s | Typed "pizza" but IME_ENTER didn't fire |

**Multi-step brain PROVEN:** The LLM understood a compound request, decomposed it into sequential tools, and executed them one at a time across 4 turns with tool results fed back between each.

**IME_ENTER intermittent:** Worked for weather search (Build 5 window-scan fix), failed for pizza search. Removed 300ms sleep between type and IME — fire immediately. Added try/catch + logging to catch failures.

**Deterministic intelligence overhaul deployed:** Dialog auto-dismiss, toggle detection, partial word matching, goal-word matching. Chrome search bar found deterministically without LLM call.

#### Build 7 (in progress)
- Removed sleep between type and IME_ENTER
- Added error logging for IME failures

#### Build 7 — IME_ENTER Fix Confirmed + Restaurant Search PROVEN

**IME_ENTER fix confirmed:** Removed 300ms sleep, added try/catch + logging. `[REACT] auto_ime_enter result=true` — fires immediately after type, no more intermittent failures.

**"search for restaurants near me on chrome":** Brain selected react_navigate → typed "restaurants near me" → IME_ENTER submitted → search results displayed. End-to-end working.

**Conversation context pollution observed:** Brain replayed previous bluetooth+pizza task before handling new request. The conversation history from prior tests (msg_count=8-10) confused the LLM. Need to either clear history between tasks or limit context window.

#### Session 10 Summary — 7 builds, 6 proven capabilities

| Build | What was proven |
|---|---|
| Build 1 | WSL build pipeline with Linux Android SDK |
| Build 2 | Bluetooth toggle end-to-end (7s), API latency solved (1.1s not 30-40s) |
| Build 4 | Chrome search: launch → tap search bar → type query (IME failed) |
| Build 5 | Chrome weather search end-to-end with IME_ENTER window scan |
| Build 6 | Multi-step brain: 4 tools chained (app_launch → react_navigate → bluetooth_toggle → react_navigate) |
| Build 7 | IME_ENTER consistent, restaurant search end-to-end |

**Code changes this session:**
- `plugins/withAgentNative.js`: Samsung split QS tile fix (tap icon side), IME_ENTER window scan, PKG_CHANGE log filter, QS_TOGGLE/QS_TAP full logging
- `src/core/ReActLoop.ts`: Wait for target app before observe, sparse screen overlay dismiss, parseGoal full query capture, findSearchField clickable fallback, deterministic intelligence overhaul (7 patterns), IME immediate fire
- `src/core/BrainExecutor.ts`: System prompt rewrite for multi-step reasoning, tool result feedback for chaining, 47 tools with routing hints
- `src/core/HeadlessReActHandler.ts`: skipPlanning, explicit systemPrompt
- `src/core/TaskExecutor.ts`: react_navigate blocking await, fuzzy match threshold 55, handler logging
- `src/native/AppController.ts`: performImeAction interface + implementation

#### Builds 8-13 — Problem Solver → Frontier → Jarvis

**Build 8 — Problem-solving brain:**
- Screen content fed back after react_navigate (brain sees what happened)
- Screen-aware context on every user message (brain reads current screen)
- Reasoning between tool steps ("Think: What did you learn?")
- Conversation history capped at 6 messages

**Build 9 — web_search returns real results:**
- DuckDuckGo HTML fetch with 4-tier regex extraction
- `read_text_on_screen` uses accessibility service directly (proven reliable)
- web_search no longer opens browser when results fetched successfully

**Build 10 — Rounds 2-4, 7:**
- Cross-app data flow instructions in brain prompt
- Auth wall detection in ReActLoop (login/captcha/password screens)
- Auto-scroll when deterministic can't find target after 2 failures
- Blocker/verification instructions in brain prompt

**Build 11 — Brain stops when it has the answer:**
- After web_search returns results, explicit instruction: "Answer from these results. Do NOT open a browser."

**Build 12 — Frontier:**
- Environment model: battery, BT devices, WiFi SSID, app count in dynamic system prompt
- Knowledge persistence: learns entities from every interaction, injects known info before each request
- User profile: set_user_info stores name/email/phone/address for auto-fill
- Tool acquisition: install_app opens Play Store search
- Navigation pattern caching: successful sequences saved to AsyncStorage
- ProactiveEngine suggestions injected into brain prompt (light touch — high/medium only)
- Device awareness: connected BT devices visible to brain

**Build 13 — Jarvis (deployed):**
- `expo-speech-recognition` installed + wired for voice input
- Camera capture button in input bar
- Inline image rendering in chat (generated images show in bubbles)
- Image path propagation through BrainExecutor to ChatMessage
- Personality polish: "Done — Wi-Fi toggled." not verbose engineer-speak
- Brain identity: "Ultra — capable, concise, sharp assistant"
- Auth regex fixed (word boundary, catches "Sign in to Google")
- Dialog dismiss tightened (≤10 nodes, skip first iteration)
- 48 tools total

#### Build 13 Live Testing Issues

**Self-interaction persists:** HeadlessJS react_navigate reads Agent Ultra's own chat screen when it returns to foreground. The `screenContent` field contained the agent's own response text. The GATE blocks taps but not reads.

**Payload bloat:** Brain messages reached 19-20KB (msg_count=9-11) causing 11-23 second LLM responses. The environment model + knowledge + screen content + conversation history inflates the prompt.

**LLM hallucinated URLs:** Brain invented "bestvaluegpu.com" for react_navigate. No validation on URLs before passing to the launcher.

**Stop button ineffective:** User cannot interrupt a stuck HeadlessJS/ReActLoop. The stop button aborts the LLM fetch but not the background task.

**ADB connection unstable:** USB ADB drops offline every 30-60 seconds throughout the session. Device restart + wireless debug did not resolve. Makes live log monitoring nearly impossible. Suspected: USB cable quality, Samsung USB power management, or Windows USB driver issue.

- **Status:** Build 13 deployed. Toggles, Chrome search, multi-step tasks, web search with text results all PROVEN across Builds 2-9. Builds 10-13 features (knowledge, environment, voice, images, proactive) deployed but runtime-unproven due to ADB instability. Five bugs identified for Build 14.
- **Next (Build 14):**
  1. Fix self-interaction: HeadlessJS must abort if screen is com.agent.ultra
  2. Fix stop button: add cancellation flag to ReActLoop checked each iteration
  3. Fix payload bloat: trim messages to keep under 8KB
  4. Fix URL hallucination: validate URLs before react_navigate
  5. Fix prompt leaking: clean tool result prompts
  6. Fix ADB: try different USB cable, adb tcpip 5555, or USB power management settings

### Session 9 continued (2) — Full Tool Inventory Wiring

- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition)

#### What changed

Expanded BrainExecutor TOOLS string from 30 to 47 tools. Every tool that has a working handler in TaskExecutor is now exposed to the LLM. Added 21 routing hints in TOOL SELECTION so the LLM picks the right tool for natural language patterns.

**New tools added (17):** news_headlines, battery_status, screen_record_start, calendar_create, file_open, open_url, share_content, app_info, clipboard_write, clipboard_read, media_play, media_next, image_generate, tts, memory_recall, knowledge_query, set_user_name

**Intentionally excluded handlers (internal/dangerous/dormant):** file_delete, file_organize, media_access, app_share, code_generate, app_build, app_install, app_test, dependency_resolve, network_request, ai_query, self_modify, self_replicate, app_control, multi_step, event_trigger_set/list/remove, user_correction, proactive_suggestions, task_resume, behavior_patterns, vision_read, video_generate

#### Files Changed
- `src/core/BrainExecutor.ts` — TOOLS string expanded from 30→47 tools, TOOL SELECTION routing hints expanded

- **TypeScript:** 0 errors
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED, no rebuild needed (JS-only change)

### Session 9 continued — toggleQuickSetting Logging + Toggle Tool Routing + QS Shade Fix

- **Date:** 2026-04-06
- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Device Control), A (Brain/Cognition)

#### Toggle tools exposed to LLM

Added `wifi_toggle`, `bluetooth_toggle`, `airplane_mode`, `do_not_disturb` to BrainExecutor's TOOLS string with explicit routing hints ("Turn on/off wifi" = wifi_toggle, NOT react_navigate). `flashlight_toggle` was already listed. TaskExecutor already handles all five via existing `case` handlers. Pure routing fix — no new implementations.

#### toggleQuickSetting logging overhaul

**Root cause of invisible logs:** `toggleQuickSetting()` and `tapQuickSettingsTile()` used `emitA11yLog("A11Y_QS_TRACE", ...)` which sends to JS event queue — invisible in `adb logcat -s AgentA11y:*`. Replaced all with `Log.i(TAG, ...)` using tags `QS_TOGGLE:` and `QS_TAP:`.

**New log points in toggleQuickSetting:**
- `QS_TOGGLE: start tile=X` — entry
- `QS_TOGGLE: screen=WxH` — screen dimensions
- `QS_TOGGLE: swipe_shade result=X` — notification shade pull-down
- `QS_TOGGLE: swipe_expand result=X` — expand to full QS
- `QS_TOGGLE: first_attempt / second_attempt result=X` — tap results
- `QS_TOGGLE: dismissing shade` — shade cleanup
- `QS_TOGGLE: complete tile=X result=X` — exit

**New log points in tapQuickSettingsTile:**
- `QS_TAP: root_pkg=X children=N` — what window we're reading
- `QS_TAP: search tile=X text_matches=N desc_match=X total=N` — node search results
- `QS_TAP: candidate text=X desc=X y=N clickable=X bounds=X` — each candidate node
- `QS_TAP: skip_node (status_bar) ...` — filtered nodes
- `QS_TAP: found_clickable_ancestor depth=N bounds=X` — ancestor found
- `QS_TAP: ACTION_CLICK result=X` — click attempt
- `QS_TAP: gesture_tap result=X` — fallback gesture

#### QS shade dismiss fix

Shade dismiss now **always** runs (previously only on success). Uses swipe-up + GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK as belt-and-suspenders. Increased animation wait times: 500→600ms for shade pull, 700→800ms for expand.

#### Files Changed
- `src/core/BrainExecutor.ts` — 4 toggle tools + routing hints in TOOLS string
- `plugins/withAgentNative.js` — complete logging overhaul of toggleQuickSetting + tapQuickSettingsTile, shade dismiss fix

- **TypeScript:** 0 errors
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN. Config plugin changed, requires `expo prebuild --clean` + rebuild.
- **Grep for logs:** `adb logcat -s AgentA11y:* | grep -E 'QS_TOGGLE|QS_TAP'`
- **Next:**
  1. Build and test "turn on airplane mode" — verify LLM picks `airplane_mode` tool (not react_navigate)
  2. Read QS_TOGGLE/QS_TAP logs to see if shade opens, tiles found, taps fire
  3. If `QS_TAP: search ... total=0` → tile label mismatch, try different labels
  4. If `QS_TAP: root_pkg != com.android.systemui` → shade not visible, timing issue
  5. If ACTION_CLICK returns false and gesture_tap returns false → Samsung blocking accessibility clicks on QS

### Session 9 — API Latency Investigation + GATE Self-Interaction + goalAchieved Verification

- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Source:** Chat Claude analysis of Session 8 runtime logs — 3 problems identified

#### Problem 1 — ReActLoop API Latency Investigation

**Initial conclusion "model is slow" was WRONG.** Chat mode with the same model/provider is instant. The delay is in our code path.

**Code path trace (both paths are identical from AiService onward):**
```
Chat path:
  BrainExecutor.runLoop → ai.completeWithConversation(messages, {maxTokens:1500})
    → bridge.completeConversation → AiService.completeText → adapter.invokeChat
    → openaiChatInvoke → safeFetch(url, {stream:false}) → Venice API

ReActLoop path:
  HeadlessReActHandler → ai.complete(prompt, {maxTokens:150, systemPrompt:...})
    → bridge.completeConversation → AiService.completeText → adapter.invokeChat
    → openaiChatInvoke → safeFetch(url, {stream:false}) → Venice API
```

**Known differences:**
- Chat: `maxTokens: 1500`, `temperature: 0.2`, `agentId: 'brain'`, messages include conversation history (up to 20 messages)
- ReActLoop: `maxTokens: 150`, `temperature: 0.1`, `agentId: 'react'`, messages are always fresh (1 system + 1 user)
- Both: `stream: false`, same adapter (`openai_compatible_chat`), same `safeFetch`

**Possible causes NOT yet ruled out (need runtime data):**
- `tryGetVisionContext()` fires when nodes < 8 — this makes an ADDITIONAL API call to the vision pipeline before the main call
- `resolveRoute()` in AiService may be slow (hits GroupRouter, provider scan)
- Native calls (`getActivePackage`, `getScreenContentFlat`, `allowPackage`) may block longer than expected in headless context
- Something in the HeadlessJS JS bridge may throttle network or timers

**Instrumentation added** (all log via `console.warn` for adb logcat):
- `[REACT_TIMING]` — initial_observe, per-iteration refresh+getNodes, vision_context, prompt size, aiCall duration
- `[AISVC_TIMING]` — resolveRoute duration, invokeChat duration
- `[ADAPTER_TIMING]` — HTTP fetch start (with body_bytes, msg_count, max_tokens, agent), fetch_done, json_parse
- `[HEADLESS]` — total execute duration

**Grep pattern for analysis:** `adb logcat | grep -E 'REACT_TIMING|AISVC_TIMING|ADAPTER_TIMING'`

**Planning call still skipped** (`skipPlanning: true`) — saves one LLM round-trip regardless of the latency root cause.
**Explicit systemPrompt** passed to avoid redundant default.

#### Problem 2 — GATE Passes for com.agent.ultra

**Investigation:** `checkPackageAllowed()` in AgentAccessibilityService auto-allows ANY package that isn't user-blocked, including `com.agent.ultra`. The JS-side wrong-app detection (Session 8 Bug 3) catches this at iteration boundaries but cannot prevent the GATE from passing at the native level.

**Fix:** Added `"com.agent.ultra".equals(currentPackage)` check as the FIRST line of `checkPackageAllowed()`. Returns false with `GATE: BLOCKED_SELF` log. This is a hard block at the Java accessibility layer — no tap, text, scroll, or swipe can ever execute against Agent Ultra's own UI, regardless of JS-side state.

#### Problem 3 — goalAchieved=true Without Verification

**Investigation:** Three paths to goalAchieved=true in ReActLoop:
1. Deterministic "done" action (line ~247) — no package check
2. LLM "done" action (line ~351) — no package check
3. Post-loop `checkCompletion` (line ~389) — asks LLM "is goal achieved?", no package check

The agent typed into its own chat and declared success because none of these paths verified the foreground package.

**Fix:** All three paths now check: if `expectedPkg` is set, verify `currentPkg === expectedPkg`. If on `com.agent.ultra` or a different wrong app, goalAchieved is forced to false with `wrong_app_at_done` error.

#### Problem 4 — Toggle tools not exposed to LLM

**Investigation:** `wifi_toggle`, `bluetooth_toggle`, `airplane_mode`, `do_not_disturb` all have full implementations in TaskExecutor (lines 1952-1986) using `toggleQuickSetting()` which is a Java-level QS tile tap. But BrainExecutor's TOOLS string didn't list them. The LLM picked `react_navigate` for every toggle request because it didn't know direct tools existed.

**Fix:** Added 4 tools to BrainExecutor's TOOLS string + explicit routing hints in TOOL SELECTION section ("Turn on/off wifi" = wifi_toggle, NOT react_navigate). `flashlight_toggle` was already listed.

#### Files Changed
- `src/core/ReActLoop.ts` — skipPlanning option, package verification on all 3 goalAchieved paths
- `src/core/HeadlessReActHandler.ts` — skipPlanning: true, explicit systemPrompt
- `plugins/withAgentNative.js` — GATE BLOCKED_SELF for com.agent.ultra
- `src/core/BrainExecutor.ts` — added wifi_toggle, bluetooth_toggle, airplane_mode, do_not_disturb to TOOLS + routing hints
- `src/core/provider/CapabilityAdapters.ts` — timing instrumentation
- `src/core/provider/AiService.ts` — timing instrumentation

- **TypeScript:** 0 errors
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN. Config plugin changed (GATE fix), requires `expo prebuild --clean` + full rebuild.
- **Next:**
  1. Build and test all fixes
  2. **Critical:** Read `[REACT_TIMING]`, `[AISVC_TIMING]`, `[ADAPTER_TIMING]` logs to find where the 30-40s goes. Expected output per iteration:
     - `refresh=Xms getNodes=Xms` — should be <100ms each
     - `vision_context: Xms` — if this is 10+ seconds, it's making a vision API call
     - `resolveRoute: Xms` — should be <50ms
     - `ADAPTER_TIMING start: body_bytes=X` — shows actual payload size
     - `ADAPTER_TIMING fetch_done: Xms` — THIS is the actual network time
     - `aiCall: Xms` — total including all overhead
  3. If `fetch_done` is fast but `aiCall` is slow → overhead is in JS/bridge layers
  4. If `fetch_done` is slow → same endpoint as chat? check URL/model
  5. If `vision_context` is slow → it's making an extra API call, disable it
  6. Verify GATE: `BLOCKED_SELF` when on Agent Ultra
  7. Verify goalAchieved rejected on wrong app

### Session 8 — Brain-Layer Bug Fixes — All 5 PROVEN on Device

- **Date:** 2026-04-05
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control), H (Build/Release — config plugin for IME)
- **Source:** Chat Claude handoff identifying 5 runtime bugs from 2 test sessions + internal logs

#### Problem

Session 7 proved the infrastructure works (HeadlessJS, accessibility, screen reading, taps). But every real multi-step task failed due to brain-layer decision bugs: the tool loop didn't wait for react_navigate, garbage fuzzy matches launched wrong apps, the agent didn't detect wrong-app states, taps used LLM-guessed coordinates, and text input never pressed Enter.

#### Bug Fixes Implemented and Tested

**Bug 1 — react_navigate blocks tool loop: PROVEN**
- `TaskExecutor.ts`: react_navigate sets up `DeviceEventEmitter` listener for `headlessReActComplete`, wraps in Promise with 300s timeout, awaits it. Returns actual result (goalAchieved, steps, finalObservation) to BrainExecutor.
- `HeadlessReActHandler.ts`: Every exit path now emits `headlessReActComplete` so the Promise always resolves.
- **Evidence:** HeadlessJS task completes before BrainExecutor issues next tool. Chrome did not launch until Settings task finished. Zero SAFETY STOPs (down from 9 pre-fix).

**Bug 2 — Fuzzy match rejects garbage: PROVEN**
- `TaskExecutor.ts`: react_navigate's `findBestMatch` threshold raised from 35 to 55. Non-exact/non-directory matches below 55 rejected.
- **Evidence:** "connections" correctly rejected — logged `no match for appHint: connections`.

**Bug 3 — Wrong-app detection in ReActLoop: PROVEN**
- `ReActLoop.ts`: Resolves `expectedPkg` from appHint before loop. Each iteration checks `currentPkg` vs `expectedPkg`. System overlays (keyboard, systemui, smartcapture) ignored. Wrong app → `performBack()` + retry. 3 failures → abort with clear error.
- **Evidence:** Detected `com.osp.app.signin` as wrong app (expected `com.android.settings`). Detected `com.sec.android.app.launcher` as wrong — aborted with `"Wrong app: expected com.android.settings but stuck on com.sec.android.app.launcher"`, steps=0.

**Bug 4 — Tap coordinate snapping: NOT TRIGGERED**
- `ReActLoop.ts`: When LLM emits `tap(x,y)`, snaps to nearest interactive node within 150px. System prompt updated to emphasize `tap(N)` over coordinate guessing.
- **Evidence:** LLM used correct `tap_index(N)` format in all 4 tests. Snap code exists but was never needed. Validated by code review.

**Bug 5 — IME_ENTER auto-submit: PROVEN**
- `plugins/withAgentNative.js`: New `performImeAction()` in `AgentAccessibilityService` using `ACTION_IME_ENTER` (API 30+). Bridged through `AccessibilityBridgeModule`.
- `src/native/AppController.ts`: Added `performImeAction()` to interface and implementation.
- `ReActLoop.ts`: `type("text")` auto-calls `performImeAction()` after success. New `submit()`/`enter()` action available. System prompt updated.
- **Evidence:** Chrome pizza search: `TEXT "pizza" result=true → IME_ENTER firing → IME_ENTER result=true → WAIT_UI changed=true`. Search results appeared.

#### Runtime Test Results (4 tests)

1. **"open settings and turn off wifi"** — Settings opened, HeadlessJS ran, but LLM took 30-50s per call. Android closed Settings for inactivity. Agent tapped Samsung Account (wrong item). Bug 3 detected wrong app correctly. Task failed due to LLM latency.
2. **"open settings and go to connections"** — Bug 2 rejected "connections" as no match. Bug 3 detected wrong app. Task failed — LLM doesn't understand "Connections" is a Settings submenu.
3. **"open chrome and search for pizza"** — SUCCEEDED. Chrome opened, search bar tapped, "pizza" typed, IME_ENTER submitted, search results appeared. End-to-end success.
4. **Settings navigation retry** — Same LLM latency issue. Agent hit Connected Devices (y=1766) and Settings Search in separate attempts. Every Settings task failed due to model speed.

#### Files Changed
- `src/core/TaskExecutor.ts` — Bug 1 (blocking await) + Bug 2 (confidence threshold)
- `src/core/HeadlessReActHandler.ts` — Bug 1 (always emit result) + exported `HeadlessReActResult` type
- `src/core/ReActLoop.ts` — Bug 3 (wrong-app detection) + Bug 4 (tap snap) + Bug 5 (submit/enter actions, auto-IME, updated system prompt)
- `plugins/withAgentNative.js` — Bug 5 (native `performImeAction` in accessibility service + bridge)
- `src/native/AppController.ts` — Bug 5 (`performImeAction` interface/noop/implementation)

#### New Issues Identified (not fixed this session)
- **(A)** SmartCapture overlay floods logs — needs adding to overlay ignore list
- **(B)** Wrong-app recovery should re-launch expected app, not just press BACK
- **(C)** When Bug 2 rejects appHint, ReActLoop still starts on whatever screen — should abort immediately
- **(D)** LLM doesn't understand Settings submenus — needs deterministic Settings navigation or better prompting
- **(E)** askUser action needed for captcha/dialog handling
- **(F)** Dormant code cleanup pending: TaskBuilder, Genome, SelfImprover, AppBuilder → src/dormant/

- **TypeScript:** 0 errors
- **Status:** PROVEN. All 5 fixes verified on device. Infrastructure + brain layer both working. Bottleneck is now LLM latency (30-50s/call) and LLM decision quality (Settings menu navigation), not Agent Ultra's code.
- **Next:**
  1. Investigate faster model options (Claude Haiku, Gemini Flash, local model) for ReActLoop calls
  2. Fix issues A-C (SmartCapture ignore, wrong-app re-launch, abort on no-match)
  3. Consider deterministic navigation for Settings (bypass LLM for known menu structures)
  4. Test more apps: Messages, Maps, Calculator, Phone
  5. Dormant code cleanup (issue F)

### Session 7 — ROOT CAUSE SOLVED + HeadlessJS Background Execution PROVEN WORKING

- **Date:** 2026-04-04 through 2026-04-05
- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Native/Device Control), H (Build/Release), A (Brain/Cognition)
- **Duration:** Extended session across two days, 6+ build cycles (~70-80 min each)
- **Milestone:** Agent Ultra autonomously controlled another app's UI for the first time in the project's history.

#### Root Cause Discovery

The fundamental blocker across Sessions 1-6 was identified: **React Native's JS thread suspends when the Activity goes to background.** When Agent Ultra launches YouTube via `react_navigate`, the Activity loses foreground status. React Native suspends the JS thread entirely — `setTimeout` never fires, the ReActLoop never starts, LLM calls never happen. The Java-side accessibility service keeps running (PKG_CHANGE events flow), creating the illusion something should work.

**Evidence that proved this:**
- Logcat with accessibility service properly bound showed YouTube opening, then 39 seconds of total JS silence — no moveTaskToBack, no SCREEN_FLAT, no LLM calls.
- In ALL previous tests, moveTaskToBack only fired because the user manually returned to Ultra (waking the JS thread).
- PKG_CHANGE events continued throughout, proving the Java accessibility service was alive while JS was frozen.
- This explains every Session 1-6 failure: the agent's brain (JS) was asleep the moment another app took foreground.

#### WSL Build Pipeline

EAS cloud builds cached stale native code (Sessions 5-6 blocker). Local Windows Gradle builds crashed with `useState` null error (Session 6 blocker). Solution: WSL-based local EAS builds.

**Build steps (from WSL):**
1. `rsync -av --delete /mnt/c/au/ ~/agent-ultra/ --exclude node_modules --exclude .git --exclude android --exclude ios`
2. `cd ~/agent-ultra && npm install`
3. `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 npx eas build --local --profile preview --platform android`
4. `cp` the APK back to Windows, `adb install -r`

#### Solution Implemented: HeadlessJS Delegation

- **`plugins/withAgentNative.js`** (config plugin):
  - `AgentHeadlessTaskService.java` — minimal HeadlessJsTaskService (getTaskConfig + onDestroy only, no startForeground). Timeout 300000ms (5 min). Fixed import: `com.facebook.react.jstasks` (not `jstask`). Added `writeFileSync` to write file to disk. Added `<service>` manifest entry.
  - `AgentNativeModule.java` — new `@ReactMethod startReActTask(goal, appHint, taskId)`: calls `getCurrentActivity().moveTaskToBack(true)` in native Java, then starts `AgentHeadlessTaskService` via `startService()` with goal/appHint/taskId as Intent extras. Added `import android.os.Bundle`.
- **`src/core/HeadlessReActHandler.ts`** (NEW): Registers `AppRegistry.registerHeadlessTask('AgentBackgroundTask', handler)`. Handler receives task data from Intent extras, gets ModelRouter from AgentCore singleton, creates ReActLoop, runs `execute(goal, appHint)`, emits `headlessReActComplete` event via DeviceEventEmitter. Full console.warn breadcrumbs for adb logcat.
- **`src/native/AgentNative.ts`**: Added `startReActTask(goal, appHint, taskId)` to interface, noop mock, and native wrapper.
- **`app/_layout.tsx`**: Added `import '@/src/core/HeadlessReActHandler'` (side-effect import to register HeadlessJS task at startup).
- **`src/core/TaskExecutor.ts`**: react_navigate case no longer runs ReActLoop inline. Removed all 3 JS-side `moveTaskToBack()` calls and their `setTimeout(500/2000/3000)` delays. After launching the target app, calls `AgentNative.startReActTask(goal, appHint, taskId)` and returns immediately with `"Navigation started... Agent is working in the background."` The HeadlessJS handler does the actual work.

#### Build Issues Fixed (6 iterations)

1. Missing `android.os.Bundle` import in AgentNativeModule
2. `AgentHeadlessTaskService.java` never written to disk (writeFileSync missing from config plugin)
3. Wrong import path `com.facebook.react.jstask` → `com.facebook.react.jstasks` for RN 0.81
4. Missing `<service>` manifest entry for AgentHeadlessTaskService — "not found" at runtime
5. MissingForegroundServiceTypeException on Android 14+ — removed startForeground entirely, HeadlessJsTaskService base class handles lifecycle
6. Changed startReActTask from startForegroundService to startService
7. moveTaskToBack and startReActTask called from JS (which was already suspended) — moved both to native Java in startReActTask method

#### Runtime Proof

**Test:** "open YouTube and search for shorts"

**Logcat evidence:**
- `[HEADLESS] received: {"taskType":"react_navigate","goal":"...","appHint":"youtube"}`
- `[HEADLESS] starting ReActLoop for goal: ...`
- `SCREEN_FLAT: root_pkg=com.google.android.youtube` — Agent Ultra read YouTube's UI, NOT its own
- Tap actions landed on YouTube's Shorts tab
- UI change detected after tap
- ReActLoop continued iterating while Agent Ultra was backgrounded
- Zero self-interaction. Zero crashes.

**What this proves:**
- HeadlessJS keeps the JS thread alive when the Activity is backgrounded
- The accessibility service reads the correct app's UI tree (YouTube, not Agent Ultra)
- moveTaskToBack from native Java works — Agent Ultra stays backgrounded
- The full perceive→think→act→verify loop runs autonomously against another app

- **Architecture change:** react_navigate is now fire-and-forget from BrainExecutor's perspective. It returns immediately. The ReActLoop runs asynchronously in the HeadlessJS task. Results are emitted via DeviceEventEmitter and logged to adb logcat.
- **TypeScript:** 0 errors after all changes.
- **Status:** PROVEN. First successful autonomous cross-app interaction. The HeadlessJS pipeline works end-to-end: launch → native moveTaskToBack → HeadlessJS service → JS handler → ReActLoop → accessibility reads target app → actions land on target app.
- **Next:**
  1. Test with different apps beyond YouTube (Settings, Chrome, Messages)
  2. Test multi-step tasks that require more ReActLoop iterations
  3. Verify 300-second HeadlessJS timeout is sufficient for complex tasks
  4. Improve ReActLoop screen reading quality and action reliability
  5. Consider adding result callback to UI when headless task completes

### Session 6 — Local Build Pipeline + Config Plugin Confirmed + Launch Crash Unresolved
- **Date:** 2026-04-04
- **Subsystems:** H (Build/Release), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Work done:**
  - **Diagnosed config plugin mystery:** withAgentNative.js IS registered in app.json (line 111), file exists, code is correct. Ran `expo prebuild --clean` locally — generated Java in AgentAccessibilityService.java line 336 has `pkg == null || !"com.agent.ultra".contentEquals(pkg)` and all SCREEN_FLAT logs. Config plugin was never broken. EAS cloud was caching generated native code.
  - **Established local build pipeline:** `expo prebuild --clean` then `./gradlew assembleRelease` from `C:\au` (Windows junction symlink to project root — required because ninja has 260-char path limit). Symlink created with `cmd /c mklink /J C:\au "C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\Audit-Discuss-Build\Audit-Discuss-Build"`.
  - **Installed JDK 17** (Adoptium Temurin 17.0.17.10-hotspot) — system Java 26 too new for Android. Set `$env:JAVA_HOME` per-session.
  - **Created release signing keystore:** `[local path]`, alias agent-ultra, password [removed]. Never lose this file.
  - **Enabled Windows long paths registry key** — did NOT fix ninja's limit, symlink still required.
  - **Gradle auto-installed** Android SDK Build-Tools 35 & 36, Platform 36, NDK 27.1.12297006, CMake 3.22.1 to `C:\Android`.
  - **Changed `reactCompiler` from true to false** in app.json line 125.
  - **Built signed release APK locally.** App crashes on launch: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'useState' of null` at RootLayout via useFonts. Crash persists after reactCompiler fix (bundle offsets shifted confirming rebuild happened, but same crash). Root cause unknown — may be metro config difference between EAS cloud and local Gradle builds.
- **What is NOT working:**
  - Local release APK crashes on launch every time. Same `useState` null error. App never reaches the main UI. This crash did NOT exist in EAS cloud builds.
  - EAS cloud builds still have stale native code (config plugin changes not reaching APK).
- **Committed:** reactCompiler false fix (app.json line 125)
- **Status:** BLOCKED. Local builds produce correct native Java but crash on JS launch. EAS builds launch but have stale native code. Neither path currently produces a working app with the fixes.
- **Next:**
  1. Try `eas build --profile preview --platform android --clear-cache` to force EAS to regenerate everything.
  2. If `--clear-cache` works: test for `SCREEN_FLAT: using_window` in adb logcat.
  3. If `--clear-cache` fails: investigate why local Gradle metro bundling breaks React module resolution (possibly missing metro.config.js, or EAS injects config that local builds don't).
  4. Do NOT add more code fixes until a build pipeline produces a launchable app with the native fixes present.

### Session 5 (continued) — Diagnostic Deep Dive + Multiple Unproven Fixes
- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Device Control), A (Brain/Cognition), H (Build/Release)
- **Work done:**
  - Node.js upgraded 18.20.0 → 22.21.0 (required for RN 0.81/Expo/Metro)
  - Accidentally built with development profile (Chat Claude error) — produced Expo Dev Client shell, not standalone app. No lasting damage but wasted a build cycle.
  - Confirmed moveTaskToBack native wiring is correct: AccessibilityBridgeModule registers as "AppController" (line 2305), no name collision with AgentNativeModule ("AgentNative", line 40). Same Java class hosts performTap, getScreenContentFlat, AND moveTaskToBack.
  - Added diagnostic console.warn breadcrumbs at: BrainExecutor tool selection, TaskExecutor case entry, app launch result, moveTaskToBack call site, AppController native bridge (typeof/resolved/rejected).
  - Discovered react_navigate IS being selected by BrainExecutor (5 times in one capture). Session 3 tool selection fix (21167b2) works. **Earlier TOOL_NOT_SELECTED diagnosis was wrong** — masked by downstream failures.
  - Discovered moveTaskToBack DOES fire and resolves true (typeof=function, resolved=true). **Earlier METHOD_MISSING diagnosis was wrong.**
  - Discovered moveTaskToBack fires too late: 4-12 seconds after launch instead of immediately. Agent Ultra reclaims foreground before moveTaskToBack fires, pushing behind launcher not YouTube.
  - Reordered moveTaskToBack to fire 500ms after launch intent, before 2000ms delay and allowPackage (commit 736b3a4). Applied to all 3 app_launch paths.
  - Discovered getScreenContentFlat window scan rejects null-package TYPE_APPLICATION windows (line 1746: `pkg != null && ...`). YouTube may report null package during transitions on Samsung. Changed to `pkg == null || ...` (commit 59cb635).
  - Added `"prebuildCommand": "npx expo prebuild --clean"` to eas.json preview profile to force config plugin regeneration (commit 7d28ac4).
- **What is NOT working — every runtime test failed:**
  - Every SCREEN_FLAT shows root_pkg=com.agent.ultra. YouTube has NEVER appeared in a SCREEN_FLAT read across all tests this session.
  - YouTube NEVER appears in any WINDOWS dump. Only systemui, launcher, honeyboard, agent.ultra.
  - All TAP/TEXT/SCROLL actions hit com.agent.ultra, honeyboard, or systemui. Zero actions against YouTube.
  - Agent types "shorts" into its own text box, taps its own UI, scrolls its own UI. Same failure as Sessions 1-4.
- **EAS build caching problem (unresolved):**
  - TypeScript changes (TaskExecutor.ts, AppController.ts) appear to deploy — timing gap dropped in some runs.
  - Config plugin change (withAgentNative.js line 1746) has NEVER been confirmed in any running APK. The `SCREEN_FLAT: using_window` log line that would prove the new code is present has never appeared.
  - EAS cloud builds cache the android/ directory. Config plugin changes require `expo prebuild --clean` to regenerate Java. Added prebuildCommand to eas.json — built and tested, **did not solve the problem**. Config plugin changes still not reaching the APK.
  - EAS CLI fails locally with fingerprint error (exit code 3221225794). User must build from their terminal.
- **Committed:** 21d8016, 3b48621, 499bd3e, 30c1ef8, 736b3a4, 59cb635, 7d28ac4
- **Status:** RUNTIME-UNPROVEN. All fixes compile-clean and are committed. Zero fixes confirmed working on device. The null-package window fix has never made it into a running APK despite prebuildCommand.
- **Next:** Investigate why config plugin changes are not reaching the compiled APK. prebuildCommand did not fix it. May need to inspect generated Java in android/ after prebuild, or try a local build. Do not add more fixes until the existing ones are proven or disproven on device.

### Session 5 (initial) — moveTaskToBack Wiring Confirmed + Tool Selection Diagnosed
- **Date:** 2026-04-02
- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Device Control), A (Brain/Cognition), H (Build/Release)
- **Work done:**
  - Confirmed moveTaskToBack wiring is correct end-to-end
  - Added console.warn breadcrumbs (commit 499bd3e)
  - Initial TOOL_NOT_SELECTED diagnosis — later disproven in continued session
- **Committed:** 21d8016, 3b48621, 499bd3e
- **Status:** Superseded by Session 5 (continued) above.

### Session 4 — adb Native Layer Deep Dive + Root Cause Discovery
- **Date:** 2026-04-02
- **Subsystems:** D (Actions/Device Control), A (Brain)
- **Work done:**
  - Established adb logcat debugging workflow: `$appid = adb shell pidof com.agent.ultra; adb logcat --pid=$appid -s AgentA11y:*`
  - Added `Log.i(TAG, ...)` calls alongside all `emitA11yLog` calls so native events are visible in adb logcat (previously invisible — emitA11yLog only writes to JS queue)
  - Added comprehensive logcat observability to: checkPackageAllowed (GATE), performTap (TAP), performText (TEXT), performScroll (SCROLL), performSwipe (SWIPE), performClick (CLICK), performBack (BACK), performHome (HOME), moveTaskToBack (MOVE_TO_BACK), getScreenContentFlat (SCREEN_FLAT with root_pkg and first node labels), getActivePackage (GET_PKG), waitForUiChange (WAIT_UI), onAccessibilityEvent (PKG_CHANGE)
  - Added `dumpWindowStack()` method — logs all accessibility windows with layer order, type, package, focused state. Called from getScreenContentFlat.
  - Added import for `AccessibilityWindowInfo`
  - Removed self-check from checkPackageAllowed (was unreliable — currentPackage flips to com.agent.ultra whenever JS thread fires accessibility events even when Agent Ultra is visually in background, proven via adb)
  - Added auto-allow to checkPackageAllowed — any non-blocked package is automatically allowed
  - Added moveTaskToBack native method to AccessibilityBridgeModule + AppController.ts interface + TaskExecutor.ts call before ReActLoop.execute()
  - **Fixed getScreenContentFlat** to scan all accessibility windows via `getWindows()`, pick the first `TYPE_APPLICATION` window that isn't com.agent.ultra, and read its tree. Falls back to `getRootInActiveWindow()` only if no other app window found.
- **ROOT CAUSES DISCOVERED (all proven via adb logcat):**
  1. **CRITICAL: getScreenContentFlat() always returned Agent Ultra's own window.** `getRootInActiveWindow()` returns the accessibility service host's window — always com.agent.ultra. The agent has NEVER seen another app's UI tree. Every plan, tap target, and text input has been against its own elements.
  2. **CRITICAL: moveTaskToBack never fires.** Zero MOVE_TO_BACK log entries in any adb capture. The call path in TaskExecutor.ts is not being reached. Need to inspect lines 1625-1645 to find why.
  3. **CRITICAL: Agent Ultra's activity stays in foreground** because moveTaskToBack never fires. Target app (YouTube) never gets an accessibility window in the stack. Window dumps show only: systemui, launcher, honeyboard, and Agent Ultra.
  4. **CONFIRMED: currentPackage is unreliable** — flips between com.agent.ultra, com.android.systemui, com.samsung.android.honeyboard, and target app dozens of times per second. Self-check using currentPackage was correctly removed.
  - **Evidence:** Full adb logcat captures showing `SCREEN_FLAT: root_pkg=com.agent.ultra` on every call, WINDOWS dumps with no YouTube window, `TEXT: text=short pkg=com.agent.ultra` (typing into own text box), zero MOVE_TO_BACK entries.
- **Committed:** c6a4c0c, b4e703f, f9c3139, 770eac0, cea84fd, fd5ff9e, 252f654, bf4f139, 33f66ed, 839bced, a4b1787
- **Status:** ROOT-CAUSE-PROVEN via adb. getScreenContentFlat window fix applied. moveTaskToBack call path still unreachable.
- **Next:** Inspect TaskExecutor.ts lines 1625-1645 to find why moveTaskToBack is unreachable, then build and test both fixes together.

### Session 3 — Runtime Log Analysis + Three Fixes
- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Work done:**
  - Analyzed runtime logs from session mngc4pfq (8931 entries) and live test session
  - Found and fixed three runtime-proven bugs:
  1. **BrainExecutor tool selection** (21167b2): LLM picked app_launch/web_search instead of react_navigate for "open X and do Y" tasks. Fixed tool descriptions and added TOOL SELECTION routing rules to system prompt.
  2. **ReActLoop foreground gate** (c4e6970): planSteps() ran while Agent Ultra was still in foreground, producing plans targeting its own UI elements ("tap Agent Ultra", "tap Ask Agent Ultra..."). Added foreground polling gate — waits up to 6s for target app, re-observes, returns clear error if timeout.
  3. **Native checkPackageAllowed keyboard bug** (e240eba): Every performTap/performText/performScroll was silently returning false whenever Samsung keyboard (honeyboard) was visible. checkPackageAllowed() used currentPackage which flips to keyboard on every keystroke. Fixed to use getRootInActiveWindow().getPackageName() — the actual app, not the keyboard overlay. THIS WAS THE ROOT CAUSE of all "result=false" failures in the ReActLoop.
  - **Evidence chain:** seq 658-702 (browser opens, Agent Ultra returns to foreground, planner sees own UI), seq 9267-9449 (LLM chose app_launch then web_search, never tried react_navigate), runtime observation of taps returning false with keyboard visible.
- **Committed:** 21167b2, c4e6970, e240eba
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED, COMPILE-VERIFIED, RUNTIME-UNPROVEN (needs new build + device test)
- **Next:** Build and test all three fixes together. If taps land reliably, react_navigate becomes functional.

### Session 2 — ReActLoop Planning Step + Replit Prompt Verification
- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Work done:**
  - Grep-verified all Replit prompt 12/13/14 fixes are applied: DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS safety gate, Samsung Smart Capture dismiss, stuck loop prevention (prevWasSameTool), TAPPABLE/TYPEABLE/SCROLLABLE screen classification, RECENT ACTIONS history injection
  - Applied SOLUTION_react_navigate_planning_step.md — 5 edits to src/core/ReActLoop.ts:
    1. Added planSteps() method — one-time AI planning call producing 3-8 ordered UI steps
    2. Added app context resolution (AppController.getActivePackage) before loop
    3. Added per-iteration app context refresh inside loop
    4. Replaced LLM fallback prompt with plan-aware version (CURRENT STEP, FULL PLAN with progress markers)
    5. Added plan step advancement logic in both deterministic and LLM paths (advance on UI change, forced advance after 2 stuck iterations)
  - Verified appHint propagation: BrainExecutor → TaskExecutor.completeWithReActLoop → ReActLoop.execute(goal, appHint)
  - TypeScript remains at 0 errors
- **Committed:** f42909a — "feat: add planning step to ReActLoop (AppAgent pattern)"
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN
- **Next:** Device build and runtime test of a real phone task through the full perceive→plan→act→verify loop

### Session 1 — Clean TypeScript Baseline
- **Date:** 2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** All (type-level fixes across the board)
- **Work done:**
  - Fixed 165 TypeScript errors → 0 across the codebase
  - Expanded UltraLogCat type with ~167 missing log categories
  - Added missing properties to UltraExecutionResult (success), Mode union (system, vision), PricingInfo (inputPer1k/outputPer1k aliases), ChatMessage.meta (requiresApproval), Genome types (config, permissions, enabled, MutationRecord/MutationResult fields)
  - Created src/types/expo-intent-launcher.d.ts to augment ActivityAction with VIEW, DEVICE_ADMIN_SETTINGS, PERMISSION_USAGE_SETTINGS
  - Fixed call sites in ~15 files: ModelRouter, TaskExecutor, AgentCore, Cortex, DeviceContext, BuildSystem, SettingsDirectory, GroupRouter, RouteHistoryStore, CostTracker, VisionPipeline, GenomeMutator, GenomeValidator, GenomeFitness, SelfImprover, app/index.tsx, app/settings.tsx
  - Fixed UltraDevLog method signatures to match actual callers (modelSetDefault, modelDiscoveryStart, modelApiResponse, etc.)
  - Confirmed architecture: AgentCore.execute() → BrainExecutor.execute() (line 587). BrainExecutor has tool loop with MAX_TOOL_TURNS=12, DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS safety gate, parseToolCall()
  - Git configured: user Dafarus, email dafarus@agentultra.local
- **Committed:** 88f29c1 — "checkpoint: clean TypeScript baseline, 0 errors"
- **Status:** SOURCE-FIXED BUT RUNTIME-UNPROVEN
- **Next:** Verify Replit prompt 12/13/14 application status in live source

### Session 0 — Pre-Claude-Code Audit (Chat Claude only)
- **Date:** Pre-2026-04-01
- **Subsystems:** A (Brain/Cognition), D (Actions/Device Control)
- **Work done:**
  - Chat Claude audited ReActLoop.ts, AgentCore.ts, TaskExecutor.ts
  - Three confirmed bugs designed for fix: self-interaction safety, memory injection into planning prompts, weather capability delegation
  - Replit prompts 12, 13, 14 were written to address these bugs
  - react_navigate overhaul designed (AppAgent pattern with planning step before loop)
- **Committed:** Multiple commits via Replit (see git log for 0680269, 93131c6, 82ae5e8, 70f9d24, 680d373)
- **Status:** CANNOT VERIFY FROM CURRENT ARTIFACTS — unknown which Replit prompts are applied in live source
- **Next:** Claude Code to grep-verify prompt application before building on top

## Local Build Reference (Framework Laptop / Native Ubuntu)

All builds run on the Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen AI 300, 16 cores, 30 GB RAM) running native Ubuntu. EAS cloud builds cache stale native code and cannot be trusted for config plugin changes. `eas build --local` on this machine is the working pipeline — ~8 minute Gradle build, ~10 minute total including prebuild and Metro bundle.

Historical note: previous environment was WSL Ubuntu on a Windows laptop. Build times there were ~70–80 minutes. Local Windows-native Gradle builds failed with `useState` null. The WSL setup also required a `C:\au` junction for the ninja 260-char path limit — not relevant on Linux-native paths.

### Prerequisites (one-time setup, already done on this machine)

- **OS:** Ubuntu (Framework Laptop 16)
- **Project root:** `~/projects/Audit-Discuss-Build`
- **Node.js:** v22.x (apt default is fine; RN 0.81/Expo needs ≥20)
- **JDK 17:** `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64` (installed via `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk`)
- **Android SDK:** `~/Android/` with `platform-tools`, `platforms;android-36`, `build-tools;36.0.0`, `ndk;27.1.12297006` (Gradle auto-installed the NDK on first build)
- **eas-cli:** installed globally to user prefix — `npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global && npm install -g eas-cli`. Binary at `~/.npm-global/bin/eas`.
- **Signing keystore:** managed by EAS cloud. `eas login` once as `dafarusd` and credentials are fetched automatically per build. No local `.keystore` file, no `credentials.json` in the project.
- **Env vars (persisted in `~/.bashrc`):**
  ```
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
  export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android
  export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Android
  export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/36.0.0
  export PATH=$HOME/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
  ```

### Build steps

1. **Install dependencies (if package.json changed, or node_modules missing):**
   ```
   cd ~/projects/Audit-Discuss-Build && npm install
   ```
   `patch-package` runs automatically via `postinstall` and applies `patches/expo-asset+12.0.12.patch`.

2. **EAS local build:**
   ```
   cd ~/projects/Audit-Discuss-Build && eas build --local --profile preview --platform android --non-interactive
   ```
   This handles prebuild + Gradle + Metro bundling + APK packaging + signing. Expect ~10 minutes end-to-end on this hardware. Output APK is written to the project root as `build-<timestamp>.apk`.

3. **Install to phone over wireless ADB:**
   ```
   adb connect <device-ip>:5555
   adb -s <device-ip>:5555 install -r build-<timestamp>.apk
   ```
   If `adb connect` is refused, the phone has rebooted and `adb tcpip 5555` mode reset. Re-pair via Android 11+ Wireless Debugging:
   - Phone: Settings → Developer options → Wireless debugging → "Pair device with pairing code"
   - Read the pairing IP:port and 6-digit code
   - `adb pair <pair-ip>:<pair-port>` (enter code when prompted)
   - Then read the main "IP address & Port" from the Wireless Debugging screen and `adb connect <ip>:<port>`

4. **Re-enable accessibility service** (required after every reinstall):
   Settings → Accessibility → Installed apps → Agent Ultra → toggle ON

5. **Capture logs:**
   ```
   appid=$(adb shell pidof com.agent.ultra)
   adb logcat --pid=$appid
   ```

### When to re-run which step

| Change made | npm install? | Full EAS build? | Reinstall? | Re-enable a11y? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript/JS source only | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `withAgentNative.js` (config plugin) | No | Yes (prebuild --clean runs automatically) | Yes | Yes |
| `app.json` changes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `package.json` / new dependency | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Wireless ADB behavior notes

- `adb tcpip 5555` mode does NOT survive phone reboots — always verify with `adb devices` first
- Do NOT test `wifi_toggle` or `airplane_mode` capabilities over wireless ADB — they kill the connection
- Android 11+ wireless pairing: every time you open "Pair device with pairing code", a NEW port and NEW code are generated. Run `adb pair` within seconds or the dialog expires.
- After pairing, you may see a ghost mDNS device entry (`adb-XXXXX._adb-tls-connect._tcp`) alongside the real IP:port device. Target commands with `adb -s <ip>:<port>` to disambiguate.

## 2026-08-29 — Replay remembers the way

**Goal:** "remember which control worked for each hop" — turn replay's
undirected search into a lookup.

**Status: PROVEN.** Two consecutive walks of a demonstrated route (Chrome page →
menu → History). Walk 1 searched six controls, learned `menu_button`, recovered
from a wrong guess that closed the menu, found `open_history_menu_id`, learned
it. Walk 2 tapped both remembered controls and nothing else. Both ended on
`HistoryActivity`. Only view ids are stored, never indexes.

Getting there uncovered six defects that all shared one shape — two parts of the
system reading the same screen and disagreeing. Full accounting with evidence in
COLD-REVIEW.md under "Replay: remembering the way".

The two that mattered most, because neither was visible from the code:

- The screen recorder saved Agent Ultra's own screens, so **every route ever
  taught began with the agent itself**. The step recorder had excluded them for
  months; the screen recorder is a different path and never learned.
- The recorder fingerprinted a screen the instant it appeared, replay judged it
  once settled. Same screen, two instants, two hashes, no possible match.

**Also fixed:** task memory was filing the watching tools as lessons, so the
agent memorised its own mistake ("when they say watch me, cancel watching").
`ask.sh` was truncating every logged line at its last colon, which sent two
rounds of debugging after a recipe store that was never empty.

**New capability:** taps resolve by view id rather than list position, and the
name the user gave a routine ranks the candidates — a replay's only statement of
human intent.

**Open:** route capture is not yet reliable (the same demonstration recorded
three screens, then two, then three). Working, not yet trustworthy. Screen
fingerprints are exact set-equality on view ids; stable across visits here but brittle
to a promo card or an empty state.

242 tests, 0 failures.

## 2026-08-29 (later) — Route capture made deterministic

**Status: PROVEN.** Three independent recordings of the same walk now produce
byte-identical routes — same screen count, same fingerprints, same order — and
those fingerprints match what the walker sees when it walks there. A route
recorded this way was then walked twice: the first walk learned both hops, the
second was a pure two-tap lookup ending on `HistoryActivity`.

**Cause:** every accessibility event started its own thread, each slept to let
the screen settle, and they all raced to record what they read. A 1200 ms
throttle inside the recorder dropped whichever lost — sometimes the only one
carrying a screen nothing else would report. Android fires a different number of
events for the same navigation every time, so the recording varied with page
load speed and thread scheduling.

**Fix:** one sampler thread, one pending read, re-armed by every event; the
screen is read once when the event stream goes quiet, at the same settle
interval the replay uses. The recorder's own throttle is deleted — coalescing
now has exactly one owner. The sampler reads the package at sample time so the
tree and the app name come from the same moment.

Held by a test stating the invariant directly: the same screens reported five
times each and once each must produce the same route.

243 tests, 0 failures.

## 2026-08-29 (later still) — P1: the agent reports what it knows

**Status: PROVEN.** Three routines now say three different true things about
themselves, all from counted facts: never walked; walked once and knows both
steps; knows both doors but has no recorded walk to claim. Proven on device by
listing before and after a first walk.

Everything is a count, never a judgement — no scores, no confidence levels.
What the agent may claim about itself is one testable function, `Competence.describe()`.

**Two real defects found building it.** A taught routine was never counted as run
at all — `markRun` sits after the journey branch returns, so `runCount` stayed 0
forever and "I have done this three times" was unsayable. And a door that moved
was found, used, then thrown away, because the save check only fired on
blank → known; an app update meant re-searching the same door on every run,
permanently.

**Honest limit:** the "app has changed" path is unit-tested, not device-proven.
Forcing a real app to move a control is not something this harness can do.

253 tests, 0 failures.

## 2026-08-29 (later still) — P2: it argues when the screen disagrees

**Status: PROVEN.** Asked to "pay 240" on a page reading Total £2,400.00 with a
Confirm payment button, it stopped: *"I stopped before pressing 'Confirm
payment': this screen says £2,400.00 and you said 240. Nothing was committed."*
Nothing was pressed and the gate was never asked.

It refuses rather than asking, deliberately. The gate can only ever say "about
to press Pay", which is equally true of the right payment and the wrong one, and
a person who has approved that card fifty times approves the fifty-first without
reading it.

**Three things the device run changed.** The check compares the user's words,
never the model's — the model rewrote "pay 240 by pressing confirm payment" into
a goal with no amount in it and silenced the check; a check reading the model's
restatement is one the model can walk around. A disagreement now ends the run.
And it ends the whole request, because even with the run ended the model called
the navigator again with a reworded goal and spent fifteen more steps looking for
another way in.

**Deliberately narrow:** money only, and only when the user named an amount, the
screen shows amounts, and none of them match. Compared as integers in minor
units — 240 is a substring of 2400, which is the exact failure it exists to
catch.

**Limits:** wrong recipient, date or quantity all pass; an unmarked total is
invisible; four currencies.

262 tests, 0 failures.

## 2026-08-31 — 2.2.0 published

Version bumped to `2.2.0-native` (versionCode 11) and published to
`Ultra-Agent-Release`: APK, README and the site all point at it, all serving
200, 8,719,220 bytes, signed with the real release key. 2.1.3 stays in the repo
so no existing link dies.

Public copy gained the capabilities that landed on 29 Aug — route learning by
demonstration, competence reporting — and three refusals that were never
described publicly: the payment-mismatch stop, a code being unable to leave the
app it was read in, and never pressing pay/send/delete while searching. Limits
were added rather than trimmed.

**Shipped without device verification, deliberately and on request.** The test
phone was unplugged and the owner asked for the release to go up first. R8 keeps
and package contents were checked instead; QC section 8 — watch a safety feature
refuse on the build being shipped — was not satisfied. Logged in
`vault/publishing/log.md` with the follow-up owed: install 2.2.0, watch it
refuse, then either record the pass or withdraw.

## 2026-08-31 (later) — 2.2.0 verified, and the outreach around it

**Device verification closed.** 2.2.0 installs over the previous build, launches,
the accessibility service binds, and it was watched refusing on the shipped
build: `DISAGREE refused "Confirm payment": this screen says £2,400.00 and you
said 240`. QC section 8 is satisfied on the artefact that shipped rather than on
one like it. `git diff` confirms 2.2.0 contains no source change since the
29 Aug proof, only the version bump, so the eight-taps-to-two claim on the
public page still stands. Release stands, nothing withdrawn.

**Published to X** (`@Dafarusd`, account verified before posting): the 2.2.0
announcement with the link at character ~236 so it sits inside the fold, a
follow-up in the same thread on the payment-mismatch stop, and a reply to a
reader who asked whether a ~4.4GB model stays resident when the agent jumps to
the browser. Answered honestly — it stays resident because the agent is a
service rather than the foreground app, so no per-turn reload; what you pay is
the low-memory killer, and 7B scores too big on the test phone anyway.

**Reddit assessed and deliberately skipped.** `u/Adventurous-Win6029` has 1 post
karma at two weeks old. r/LocalLLaMA — the only sub that fits — bans LLM-written
copy and bots posting as humans, and enforces it visibly: the top comment on the
thread I looked at was a mod-adjacent user telling the OP to rewrite their post
in their own words. A promo link from that account breaks three rules at once.
The realistic cost was the account, not the post.

**Better lever found and used.** The OP of that thread, `Onion99`, is building
Agro — a cross-platform on-device agent in Kotlin, same problem, same month —
and had publicly asked for architecture critique. Their thread was locked, but
Issues were open, so the feedback went there instead:
`github.com/Onion99/Agro/issues/2`, under `dafarusd`. Five measured findings:
the `TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED` measurement, watching screens rather than clicks,
fingerprinting only settled screens, choosing and acting having to read the same
list, and the deny-list failure where a blocked code went to the clipboard and
then a file. Platform behaviour and design lessons only, no internals.

**Tooling note worth keeping.** GitHub's new-issue form swallows the first
keystroke burst after a click. The first attempt looked filled, submitted an
empty form, and reset without an error. Anything that fills a web form should
type, screenshot, then submit — and verify against the destination afterwards
rather than trusting the click.

**Vault backed up for the first time.** It had no second copy anywhere; `QC.md`
and `qc/` were untracked, so the gate everything passes before going public
existed as loose files in one working tree. Now committed, and
`<backup-script>` pushes both Agent Ultra and the vault when the drive is
plugged in. Verified: `vault.git` created on the drive, 284 MiB, containing
`QC.md`, `qc/prepublish.sh` and `publishing/log.md`.

## 2026-09-18 — 2.3.2 built, release-signed, on the phone

versionCode 14, `2.3.2-native`. Carries the gate fix from `a745936`: targets
match the user's request as whole tokens, not substrings.

Signed with the release key (`CN=Dafarus, OU=Agent Ultra`, SHA-256
`0d04510d…ca241f`, v2 scheme). No test code, fixtures or key strings in the APK;
`qc/prepublish.sh` passed. APK SHA-256 `726e9fbd…68f8f52f`.

The phone had the debug-signed build, which a release-signed APK can't replace.
Uninstalled on Dafarus's go-ahead (app data wiped, Venice key must be re-entered
in Settings), then installed 2.3.2. The APK pulled back off the phone is
byte-identical to the build; the app launches, no crash in the crash buffer.

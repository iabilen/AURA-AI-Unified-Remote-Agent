# Agent Ultra

**An Android agent that runs its own brain on the phone.**

Not a chat app with a cloud API behind it. A local LLM — Qwen2.5 7B, Llama 3.1 8B,
Gemma, Phi, your choice — loaded into memory on the handset, driving real tools:
the accessibility service, the camera flash, the clipboard, the browser, other
apps' user interfaces. With the network off, it still works.

## What it actually does

- **Runs on-device.** Pick a model that fits your phone and it downloads on
  demand. Nothing is bundled — the APK is 15 MB. Airplane mode, Wi-Fi off, no
  SIM: it still answers and still operates the phone.
- **Drives any app you allow.** It reads the screen through Android's
  accessibility tree and acts on it — taps, typing, scrolling, navigation.
- **Reads a page properly.** Not the first forty labels. It scrolls the whole
  thing and returns *structured items*, so a price belongs to its own product
  rather than to whichever line happened to be nearby.
- **Speaks and listens.** Hold the side button, talk, put the phone down, hear
  the answer. Transcription is on-device.
- **Remembers what worked.** A task that succeeds is recorded with its
  arguments; ask the same thing in different words later and it recalls the
  approach. Name a run and it becomes a routine you can replay.

## What it will not do

This is the part worth reading.

- **It only enters apps you tick.** Allowlist by default, and it fails closed.
  Whatever the agent reads is sent to the cloud model to decide the next step,
  so "don't look" matters as much as "don't act".
- **Messages, contacts and location are off by default**, behind their own
  switch, because they read Android's databases rather than the screen — the
  app list does not cover them.
- **A tap that commits something stops and asks.** Pay, buy, order, confirm,
  send, transfer, delete, subscribe. Both indexed and raw-coordinate taps, so
  the check cannot be sidestepped by choosing coordinates. An unanswered prompt
  is a refusal, never an approval.
- **It cannot pass your fingerprint or PIN.** Anything behind one ends with the
  phone in your hand.
- **Notification logging is off by default** and never records a protected app.

## The three projects behind it

**gatellml — the policy gate.** A deterministic enforcement layer, ported to
Kotlin and running on the handset. Every tool call is checked against a
deny-by-default manifest before it executes: a tool that is not declared cannot
run at all. Arguments carry their origins, so an action whose target never
appeared in your request is blocked and handed back to you to confirm. The model
is never trusted; the program is. Research and measurements:
[github.com/dafarusd/gate](https://github.com/dafarusd/gate)

**gate — the resolve channel.** The research named an untested gap: a gate with
no interactive channel can only refuse. That gap is closed here. A block that a
human could legitimately cure pauses the run, shows the exact target, and waits.
Your tap mints it trusted for that episode and the work continues. Taint, spoofing
and undeclared tools are never confirmable, by design.

**Mind Meld — the split that made the small models usable.** A 1B model on a
phone will not emit clean JSON, and no amount of prompting fixes that. Mind Meld
established the division: **the model owns intent, the engine owns structure.**
Ask for the flashlight and the model supplies only the intent; a deterministic
parser builds the call. That one idea is why a phone-sized model can drive real
tools instead of merely talking about them — and it is used again for routine
names, after a 70B model read "run my morning briefing" as a question about
which model it was.

## Install

Download the APK from the latest release, allow the install, and open it.

1. **Settings → WHERE THE AGENT MAY GO** — tick the apps it may enter. Nothing
   is reachable until you do.
2. **Settings → AI PROVIDER** — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
3. **Settings → ON-DEVICE MODEL** — the list is scored against *your* phone's
   memory: fits comfortably, tight, or too big.
4. Enable the accessibility service when prompted.

Requires Android 8.0 or newer, arm64.

## Honest limits

- In-app navigation handles direct tasks well and still struggles with long
  multi-step flows inside unfamiliar apps.
- Structured extraction reads *ordered* fields. It knows which lines belong to
  one item; it does not label which is the title and which is the rating.
- Some apps detect accessibility services and refuse to run. That is their
  choice and it is not worked around.
- Speed on-device depends on the model you pick. A 7B is a far better offline
  brain and a far worse quick answer than a 1B, so the fast path is reserved for
  small models and the large ones handle offline and explicit requests.
